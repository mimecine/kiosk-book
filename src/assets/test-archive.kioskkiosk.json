In theory, the size of the Gamsbart reflects the size of the owner's manliness. Franz Blumtritt and Sons was established in 1923, the founder's granddaughter Regina Erb now runs the company. Grandfather Blumtritt began with following traditional patterns from the Alps - time passed, and in the 50s one of his sons took some creative license and developed the collection they have today.

In 2002, Marco and I were living in Brussels. We were there on a type of residency and staying for free at an old friend's. She was in France working on a film. As her father was a film producer, he often had directors and editors living over us in his spare pad. While we were there, a team was editing a film for the \"Not in Our Name\" Project. Over and over again, we heard this slogan at all hours of the night. During the course of our stay, a movement I supported became one I wanted to gag. \"Not in Our Name\"? Damn right - but please, not at 2 am! Not in my freakin' ears! Such is the life of free accommodations. The whole thing only lasted for a month. Now when I read the slogan, I have a flashback and hear the chanting. I don't feel queasy remembering the sleepless nights.

In 2002, Marco and I were living in Brussels. We were there on a type of residency and staying for free at an old friend's. She was in France working on a film. As her father was a film producer, he often had directors and editors living over us in his spare pad. While we were there, a team was editing a film for the \"Not in Our Name\" Project. Over and over again, we heard this slogan at all hours of the night. During the course of our stay, a movement I supported became one I wanted to gag. \"Not in Our Name\"? Damn right - but please, not at 2 am! Not in my freakin' ears! Such is the life of free accommodations. The whole thing only lasted for a month. Now when I read the slogan, I have a flashback and hear the chanting. I don't feel queasy remembering the sleepless nights. I feel queasy because we can, and still do, chant this slogan with good reason. I don't mind paying taxes, but I do mind how my tax money is being spent in the USA. You can't please 'em all.

While visiting Little Havana, we stopped in for a few Cuban coffees - \"Versailles\" being the largest and most crowded café. It's interesting - the name didn't make logical sense at the time, but I have never forgotten it, so it works. Anyway, Cuban coffee is made with espresso and sugar. Some sugar is placed in a container (preferably metal, like the one we also have) and the espresso is brewed directly into the same pot - ideally a little bit - then stirred and then the rest of the espresso is added. It's strong and the sugar is a double-whammy follow-up. At Versailles, it is really nice to go to the walk-up window and have a guava pastry with your coffee. Damn, it's a reason in itself to visit Miami! In 1865, the founder of Rowland Coffee, Mr. Souto, started brewing Cuban-style coffee, Cafe Bustelo currently being their most famous brand. Oquendo and Souto are both espresso coffees and a good start if you are interested in brewing your own Cafecito, Café Cubano, Cuban espresso, Cuban pull, Cuban shot, etc. I am drinking some now.

Five years later we started working on America 4, focusing on things made in Vermont, and I remembered Catamount. We drove up to meet Alain and Paula. Lo and behold! Welcome to a world of invention and creation, a world of glass and a place of progress. A mug of all mugs, it even comes in two sizes. Borosilicate glass means it is easy to see the color of your brew, it won't crack from boiling water, and the handle does not get hot. </span></p>","featuredImage":{"url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/2901/products/Catamount_Mug_Large.jpeg?v=1406073471"},"metafields":{"edges":[{"node":{"namespace":"twilio","key":"twilio_id","value":"1174"}}]}}},{"node":{"title":"Cedar Cutting Board","handle":"cedar-cutting-board","description":"7\" x 14\" x 1.25\"CedarJAPAN Second came the cedar cutting board.Before, I owned only two Teflon boards:ONE for fish and ONE for onions.For vegetables I had none,but I was looking for something...maple boards from Vermont are aesthetically lovely,but only for cheese and crackers.

The same beverage, which is called “Turkish” in many places, is also called “Arabic” (with sub-chapters</span><span>:</span><span> Egyptian, Syrian, </span><span>Lebanese</span><span>, </span><span>etc.</span><span>), “Greek</span><span>,”</span><span> as you know, </span><span>and</span><span> “Cypriot” and “Bosnian” coffee in their respective regions/lands. Heating water in the pot, or “briki” in Greek, one adds a small teaspoon </span><span>or two</span><span> of finely ground coffee with some sugar at the same time. A “medium” coffee, which is the way I take it, is equal parts coffee to sugar. Take </span><span>it </span><span>off the heat just as it starts to foam. Generally cooked over a flame today, it can also be found warming in a pan of hot sand, or a hovoli, to mimic the warm ash of a fire, the traditional cooking method. It is delicious. There is another magical coffee something I am wanting to tell you about, also from Greece. I could not bring it to you because it’s actually cold and frozen: it is called a frappe.The frappe is</span><span>:</span><span> Nescafe, milk, sugar</span><span>,</span><span> and ice, if you take it the standard way. No boiling required, only </span><span>blending</span><span>.

I am only a simple-minded merchant who grates Mimolette over my pasta or salad in times of decadence. And how very decadent it is to have this little hand-held device in my kitchen arsenal - practically bourgeois. Practical too, in a bourgeoisie way.

You want to know a bit about the technique, but knowing too much only sets one up for a disappointment or possible deceit. How can you play the game if you know all the tricks and rules? How can you plant a garden if you know the entire outcome?</span></p>","featuredImage":{"url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/2901/products/flowers-2.jpeg?v=1406073856"},"metafields":{"edges":[{"node":{"namespace":"twilio","key":"twilio_id","value":"1346"}}]}}},{"node":{"title":"Fly Swatter","handle":"fly-swatter","description":"3.5\" x 17\"Plastic & MetalPORTUGAL This product was the result of a request.

With all this in mind, it makes sense the sifter would become one of the more common tools in both hardware and kitchen stores alike. You may notice the number 50 displayed prominently on the side of this sieve or sifter as we call it (same thing but applied in different contexts). I have no idea what it indicates. I thought diameter, circumference? Neither. I can't imagine this is number 50 in a succession of sifters on offer - that would be a multitude of sizes. Speaking of different contexts, Danielle told me her Greek grandmother used to place tarts on an identical sifter to cool, and then, later, used the sifter to dust the top with powdered sugar.

The first step in making most Greek pottery </span><span>is the dirt gets sifted for stone before being used</span><span>. Looking through vintage images of ceramic production, what do you commonly see</span><span>? A</span><span> large sifter. With all this in mind, it makes sense the sifter would become one of the more common tools in both hardware and kitchen stores alike. You may notice the number 50 displayed prominently on the side of this sieve or sifter as we call it (same thing but applied in different contexts</span><span>).</span><span> I have no idea what it indicates. I thought diameter, circumference? Neither. I can't imagine this is number 50 in a succession </span><span>of sifters on offer</span><span> - that would be a multitude of sizes. Speaking of different contexts, Danielle told me her Greek grandmother used to place tarts on an identical sifter to cool, and then, later, used the sifter </span><span>to dust</span><span> the top with powdered sugar. Thinking about powdered sugar, it kind of resembles a fine powder or sifted dirt.

I remember making Jell-O when I was young and being fascinated by the colors in the bowl. I always wanted to stick my hand into the liquid to join with the mixed-berry red or the orange-orange jello. But when the opportunity presented itself, the Jell-O was super hot. When it cooled down, it became solid which was interesting, but not the same visual sensation. Hibiscus tea reminds me of that sensation. Like wearing really deeply saturated rose-colored glasses or looking at the world through a blue lightbulb or a transparent colored film on a movie set. I find with the injection of this type of color one quite easily is one-step removed from reality. I have never been to Colombia, but my friend Chris went this spring. He told me that hibiscus tea is quite common in many parts of the world, not only Colombia. There, they drink it cold, storing it in pitchers in the fridge. He said I would like the Cambodian version as they add lime juice to the tea which makes the red even brighter and that in Jamaica they drink it at Christmas with rum or wine.

Hibiscus tea reminds me of that sensation. Like wearing really deeply saturated rose-colored glasses or looking at the world through a blue lightbulb or a transparent colored film on a movie set. I find with the injection of this type of color one quite easily is one-step removed from reality. I have never been to Colombia, but my friend Chris went this spring. He told me that hibiscus tea is quite common in many parts of the world, not only Colombia. There, they drink it cold, storing it in pitchers in the fridge. He said I would like the Cambodian version as they add lime juice to the tea which makes the red even brighter and that in Jamaica they drink it at Christmas with rum or wine. A study in 2008 by the USDA showed consuming 3 cups of hibiscus tea a day lowers your blood pressure. That is good news.</span></p>","featuredImage":{"url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/2901/products/Hibiscus_Tea_2-1887904701-O.jpeg?v=1406074088"},"metafields":{"edges":[{"node":{"namespace":"twilio","key":"twilio_id","value":"1444"}}]}}},{"node":{"title":"Hjortronsylt","handle":"hjortronsylt","description":"4\" x 2.75\"ø, 320 g.100% Organic Cloudberries & SugarSWEDEN We provide you with a whisk to whip the cream, a cast iron waffle maker, so why on earth would we not provide you with the third key element of a Swedish tradition?

If not, then I doubt you have ever heard of the famous Vermont maple cows that make the famous Vermont maple butter. Those cows are fed nothing but hay coated with maple syrup for the first three years of their lives. Those little guys are so cute, \"sweet\" one could say. The farmer tests the milk with a maplometer until he gets a reading of equal parts maple and milk. When the balance is right, the wheels go into motion for making maple butter.

This is the case with these girls, often a statuette and a whistle all in one. Made of clay, hand-molded and hand-painted, these turned up on our travels to the village of Ocumicho in Michoacán. In my research before the trip I came across the story of Ocumicho and the little devil figures the village is famous for. Each figure depicts bizarre devil or hell characters in strange scenarios. Ocumicho is near Pátzcuaro, the center of Mexico’s Day of the Dead festivities. These statues are produced throughout the year to be sold and displayed during the festival. When we arrived in the town there was barely anyone around; given the reputation of the craft I had thought there would at least be some sign of small-scale production. We asked a group of children if they knew of anyone making the figures and they brought us to an older woman’s house, Maria Felicitas Elias Vargas. Her studio was her home and her work was fascinating, not at all overly detailed or polished. I feel it comes from the heart. After visiting her we were brought to a family of 12 who were all producing figures, from tiny to larger than life-size: the Family Pascal Gonzales. The best artist in the family was their 12-year-old daughter who had the wildest imagination; we were told she has won prizes. I am really impressed with her unknown characters. The story of our trip is funny: we asked the owner of our hotel approximately how long it would take to drive to the village, he told us 20 minutes. Two and a half hours later we arrived, laughing the whole way; it was too much. Finally returning to town at 11 o'clock that night, we made a meal at the 24-hour Quick shop (like 7-11) of ramen noodles and an avocado. One of us bought sausage to add into the ramen to make it deluxe. It was an incredible day. Fewer and fewer families are producing the figures, but we were glad to find the craft still alive and well in the village.","descriptionHtml":"<p>Assorted Sizes<br>Clay &amp; Paint<br>MEXICO</p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><span>A really interesting fact about many things from Mexico is that decorative objects often have an alternative, more practical purpose as well.

Coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world, right behind number one: OIL. Funny how we are all devotees of thick brown stuff. The first coffee was smuggled out of the Middle East by Baba Budan, a 17th century Sufi who, while on a pilgrimage to Mecca, smuggled back seven - a holy number - coffee beans to India. Coffee was a coveted commodity at the time and the Arab world had tight control on it - it was forbidden to export green coffee beans. From India, it spread to Italy, then the rest of Europe, to Indonesia through the Dutch, and then to the Americas. Ravi's was recommended to us by some local friends.

Coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world, right behind number one: OIL. Funny how we are all devotees of thick brown stuff. The first coffee was smuggled out of the Middle East by Baba Budan, a 17th century Sufi who, while on a pilgrimage to Mecca, smuggled back seven - a holy number - coffee beans to India. Coffee was a coveted commodity at the time and the Arab world had tight control on it - it was forbidden to export green coffee beans. From India, it spread to Italy, then the rest of Europe, to Indonesia through the Dutch, and then to the Americas. Ravi's was recommended to us by some local friends. Use the Ravi's with a filter, not in a coffee machine. If you like coffee, this is another option to add to your never-ending journey into the world of coffee consumption.</span></p>","featuredImage":{"url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/2901/products/Ravis_Coffee.jpeg?v=1407211465"},"metafields":{"edges":[{"node":{"namespace":"twilio","key":"twilio_id","value":"1787"}}]}}},{"node":{"title":"Raw Orange Blossom Honey","handle":"raw-orange-blossom-honey","description":"16 oz.Raw Honey derived from the Nectar of Florida Hamlin, Valencia & Naval Orange BlossomsUSA Are you familiar with the Orange Blossom Express?

To the east is a pine-covered mountain; to the west is open landscape. The town is renowned for its pottery; it is only the women of the town who are involved in the production. We arrived with no contacts, assuming since the place was so well known for its ceramics it would be easy to find the type of work we were looking for. I, always searching for authenticity, was looking for pottery done in the traditional style with natural pigments. What I had seen in the markets in San Cristobal were sweet objects, but painted with acrylic paint and often varnishedso we headed to the source. We arrived and found several dealers in shops along the main road selling acrylic-painted pieces; it was all wrong, we had to dig deeper. We walked into the town just as school was letting out and over time found a small shop. Luckily they pointed us to Guadalupe Diaz Ramerez, the maker of this piece. Now, the story could go on forever. What followed was an hour of shy communication and then three hours of discussion and demonstration in the art of traditional Amantenango ceramics. We all spoke very little Spanish as they mainly spoke Tzotzil, an indigenous language. We discovered where the pigmented clay comes from (the local hills about two hours' walking distance away); that the paints she and her daughter-in-law use are natural pigments they grind with water; the brush is made of her grandson's hair; she uses no pottery wheel, only a board with the dry clay on it to permit movement; and they use no kiln, only a wood fire which, when it is done burning, leaves the pottery and ashes behind.

When I first heard this instrument, a woman told me how lovely it is to play the glockenspiel for children at bedtime; however, I was referring to my own bedtime when speaking to her. But don't take my word for it: the Orff-based, Kodály-based, and Waldorf methodologies of music education employ the pentatonic scale, and the Steiner/Waldorf method, many theories of special education, and the Camphill Movement all rely on anthroposophic priciples. Entirely produced in Sweden, here is a pentatonic scale for ease; with this glockenspiel, it's nearly impossible to hit a wrong note. What follows are the maker's melodic words: \"We make the glockenspiel to meet the need for the true tone and beauty every person carries as an inner longing. Our intention is to inspire the player, awakening the curiosity, and lust, for playful musical creativity. The process of making a new instrument model always starts with careful examination of the basic natural phenomena related to it. We try to refine the most typical qualities of each instrument.

Entirely produced in Sweden, here is a pentatonic scale for ease; with this glockenspiel, it's nearly impossible to hit a wrong note. What follows are the maker's melodic words: \"We make the glockenspiel to meet the need for the true tone and beauty every person carries as an inner longing. Our intention is to inspire the player, awakening the curiosity, and lust, for playful musical creativity. The process of making a new instrument model always starts with careful examination of the basic natural phenomena related to it. We try to refine the most typical qualities of each instrument.

Life is so fabulous, listening to Chopin with some friends, and not quite delicately enough, eating chocolate-covered cherries one by one. What to do with the drips down the chin? Devastating! How to carefully nibble around them rather than eating whole? My lipstick? Crisis! Christ help me! My guests were mortified, as was I, you might well imagine. The next day, I sent Francis out to find a solution. He came back with the only option, Shriver's Taffy (founded in 1898!) and in an oh-so-lovely decorated box. The green pattern matches my throw pillows, and with so many colors inside, there is one to coordinate with everyone's outfit! Even purple! Now we eat salt water taffy. Cherries are such a thing of the past. Oh, yawn, life is such a bother.</span></p>","featuredImage":{"url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/2901/products/shrivers.jpeg?v=1407211708"},"metafields":{"edges":[{"node":{"namespace":"twilio","key":"twilio_id","value":"1900"}}]}}},{"node":{"title":"Sickle","handle":"sickle","description":"approx. 12\" x 6.5\"IronGREECE Honestly, this is just an amazing hand-forged tool.

It is a colonial holdover, as Chinese tea is never taken with milk or sugar. It is also known as dai pai dong milk tea (dai pai dongs are the open-air food stalls that are quickly disappearing in Hong Kong) and it is often served in cha chaan tengs, which are like Hong Kong-style diners.

The Vasarely Foundation, opened in 1976, is located just outside of Aix and is literally a massive work in itself. The structure and all of the work inside were created by Victor Vasarely, a Hungarian considered by many to be the founder of the Op-Art movement. Here are some notes from my visit: Vasarely wanted to create a \"polychromatic city of happiness\"; each room in the museum is called an \"alveolus\" after the hollow cavities found in lungs. I have one note in the center of the page all alone that says \"Planetary Folklore.\" The Foundation is trapped in time, like this poster. It's a gem of gigantic proportions, too.

The Vasarely Foundation, opened in 1976, is located just outside of Aix and is literally a massive work in itself. The structure and all of the work inside were created by Victor Vasarely, a Hungarian considered by many to be the founder of the Op-Art movement. Here are some notes from my visit: Vasarely wanted to create a \"polychromatic city of happiness\"; each room in the museum is called an \"alveolus\" after the hollow cavities found in lungs. I have one note in the center of the page all alone that says \"Planetary Folklore.\" The Foundation is trapped in time, like this poster. It's a gem of gigantic proportions, too. An optical beauty and a transitory illusion at best. We suggest the next time you go to Provence you get away from all the clichés and leave your Blue Guides at home. Go contemporary and go Vasarely.

His main interest, however, was education, in particular instilling future generations with a closeness to and inclusion in the natural world.

At 67, Kükelhaus embarked on the most active stage in his life, giving radio interviews, running workshops, consulting, and writing. In the next eight years, Kükelhaus recreated and developed his collection, which the Bavarian State commissioned to include in the International Craft Fair held in Munich in 1975. That same year, Kükelhaus began touring Germany with a caravan of circus tents and experience stations.

I first saw a version of these earrings when we were in a Roma village of families that make brass and copper objects. We visited one household, drank coffee and then had a long talk about life in general. Driving out of town we were gawking at the many half-finished palaces the Roma call home. Often not lived in, nor ever finished, these are gigantic structures with amazing tin and copper work on the roofs are mind-blowing and that is the idea. Staring up in awe, I asked our Romanian friend to stop the car. Immediately a man set upon us and two girls as well. The kids were friendly, the man suggested we give her some money. The girl had the most beautiful gold version of these earrings, the man had amazing gold teeth. Amazing, I mean it. I asked our friend to ask about the both, but he drove off terrified (the relations between the Roma and the rest of the population are generally horrible). We went back through town and upon asking about the earrings, I was told they were certainly inherited. Back to Negreni and a day of combing through all the imaginable and unimaginable, I found a small pile of these earrings and a number of handmade bangles that were for certain Roma-made. I was told they came from the workshop of a Roma man who passed away. Whether that is true or not I will never know but I think it's even better to leave it to the imagination and let it run wild. There is something about Romania, it encourages - almost nurtures - those wild runs.","descriptionHtml":"<p>.25\"ø<br>Silver<br>ROMANIA</p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><span>There is an annual market in Romania called Negreni.

I first saw a version of these earrings when we were in a Roma village of families that make brass and copper objects. We visited one household, drank coffee and then had a long talk about life in general. Driving out of town we were gawking at the many half-finished palaces the Roma call home. Often not lived in, nor ever finished, these are gigantic structures with amazing tin and copper work on the roofs are mind-blowing and that is the idea. Staring up in awe, I asked our Romanian friend to stop the car. Immediately a man set upon us and two girls as well. The kids were friendly, the man suggested we give her some money. The girl had the most beautiful gold version of these earrings, the man had amazing gold teeth. Amazing, I mean it. I asked our friend to ask about the both, but he drove off terrified (the relations between the Roma and the rest of the population are generally horrible). We went back through town and upon asking about the earrings, I was told they were certainly inherited. Back to Negreni and a day of combing through all the imaginable and unimaginable, I found a small pile of these earrings and a number of handmade bangles that were for certain Roma-made. I was told they came from the workshop of a Roma man who passed away. Whether that is true or not I will never know but I think it's even better to leave it to the imagination and let it run wild. There is something about Romania, it encourages - almost nurtures - those wild runs.</span></p>","featuredImage":{"url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/2901/products/silver_earrings_4.jpeg?v=1427132626"},"metafields":{"edges":[{"node":{"namespace":"twilio","key":"twilio_id","value":"2233"}}]}}},{"node":{"title":"Rustic Knife","handle":"rustic-knife","description":"4\"x 3.5\" bladeBone, Brass & SteelROMANIA Marco's choice from the market at Sighet - very sharp, you have to know what you are doing!

Alas, that place specifically was not a welcoming zone. Instead, I settled for a smell. A series of smells coming from the incense truck parked by the entrance to the beach. You could see the heat rising off the sand, and you could smell the most unusual odor in the air. The sticks were burning, and people pushed in, swarming his cart. I don't know why they chose him. He was just one of many, but the scent, it has never left me. Many years later, while biking in Amsterdam, I smelled that scent again. It was sudden, but it was there, and I was on that beach.

Alas, that place specifically was not a welcoming zone. Instead, I settled for a smell. A series of smells coming from the incense truck parked by the entrance to the beach. You could see the heat rising off the sand, and you could smell the most unusual odor in the air. The sticks were burning, and people pushed in, swarming his cart. I don't know why they chose him. He was just one of many, but the scent, it has never left me. Many years later, while biking in Amsterdam, I smelled that scent again. It was sudden, but it was there, and I was on that beach.

Special. A bit expensive, fois-gras of the sea. Poutargue or boutargue in French, no relationship to a potato. Slightly off-putting and then addictive. Midnight cravings in small bites, sliced very thin, with some olive oil on the top, chewed together with a small piece of baguette, a Prosecco on the side. Taken on its own in thicker slices, straight-up. Best way, in my opinion, is sliced thin and marinated in oil with rosemary and lemon, or orange and juniper for 1 hour before stirring the blend into warm linguine, always adding in a little water from the pot. This piece will serve 8 served in such a way. Keep some aside to grate on the top at the end. A traditional Mediterranean food, the Italians claim they invented it, the French say they did, the Greeks too. History will never let us know. The good news is it's delicious. The bad news is I have to send the inventory to the USA, it belongs here with me. Concentrated and with a bite. Ours comes from a producer in Martigues, just close to Marseille. In the final image you see our provider, Boutargue Meyer.

It’s easy to chop, use-whole or rolled with a mortar and pestle. For the red, it’s quite flexible. Can be ground fine or course, nice on a salad. The bold tannins in the oil that you find in the black variety come from the unripened fruit, whereas in the red, the sugar has developed and the boldness is offset with a more subtle earthy sweetness. Delicious on soft scrambled eggs and pairs well with soy and sesame oil in a cucumber and herb salad. The white is the most delicate, it must be ground as fine as your grinder can go.

Isn't it a great feeling sometimes when things really don't matter? Sexy curves.","descriptionHtml":"<p>12\" x 12\"<br>Aluminum and Rubber<br>CHINA</p>\n<p>It's not so much the form itself, although that hood is pretty good, it's the material.

They stack which means they are handy as a spare seat around the coffee table during a late night drinking game, added bonus is you don't have far to fall. This was an import that made no financial sense but I needed some for myself. I only indulge once, so, this is it. The hard, shiny, plastic is the same as our red lampshade, therefore, if you have one of those, you have a nice little set.","descriptionHtml":"<p>Just Plastic<br>Tall: 13\"x11\"x12.5\"  Short: 13\"x11\"x8.5\"<br>HONG KONG</p>\n<p>We brought these in on a whim as I either always need a step or a seat close to the ground.
