body_html: <p>January 2009. Another yearly collection to commemorate the year
  past and give energy for a leap forward. I have to say I feel there was a
  little obsessiveness in the air. It all began with Obama in 2007 and has been
  escalating ever since. Nine Objects for 2009 cater to an obsessive streak,
  several of the things were proposed by others, thank you Peter, Jason and
  Irvin.Â </p>
