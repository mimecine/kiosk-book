Summer 2008. Two trips for our first American based collection, mostly to Massachusetts: Edith Wharton, Norman Rockwell, Indian pudding, Dream-Away Lodge, the Berkshires, the Cape, Boston, the North Shore and in between; factory visits and let us not forget the Shakers. People in Massachusetts are collectors and protectors of the past. Did we touch or just look at Plymouth Rock? Eating traditional American food and still not knowing exactly what that is. It was what one would expect from New England. Massachusetts makes memories. Yankee generosity is real.
