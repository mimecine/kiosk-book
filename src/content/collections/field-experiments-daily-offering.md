  Experiments\" class=\"red\">Field Experiments</a> is a nomadic design
  collective that explores indigenous crafts by engaging in collaborative making
  with local craftspeople in diverse regions around the world. The inaugural
  Field Experiments project was conducted over three months in Bali,
  Indonesia.  From June - September 2013, designers Benjamin Harrison Bryant,
  Paul Marcus Fuog and Karim Charlebois-Zariffa set up a studio and home in
  Lodtunduh, a farming community situated on the outskirts of Ubud. They
  collaborated together and conducted daily experiments in stone masonry, wood
  carving, batik, painting, basket weaving, kite-making with a selection of
  local craftspeople. The project explores the re-assemblage of cultural craft
  objects in a tourist-driven economy. It resulted in the making of more than
  fifty one-off objects that examine the influence of transnational exchange in
  the making process. Field Experiments proposes how a souvenir can manifest and
  encourage cross-cultural learning and understanding. </div>"
