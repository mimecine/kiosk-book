body_html: <p>January 2007. 10 days in Berlin at friends and a manic 10 day tour
  of the country by car. It was hard, there was no snow in the Alps, there was a
  wind storm. The country held a tremendous amount of unique objects and bizarre
  experiences. Terry cloth sheets and empty hotels. Very little to eat as a
  vegetarian. The east still felt like the east as we imagined. A place of many
  layers and many curry wursts. Mind blowing bodies of water meets the Stasi.
  Germany is complex, deep and meaningful. I said I would never go back and yet
  I continue to contemplate the place.Â </p>
