  most tourists do. We were lucky. Hong Kong style tea and ying/yang became a

  Sleeping above a mahjong center and hearing it all night long, foods we did
  not try and ones we dared. Kindness and roughness, Hong Kong has a split
  personality. If we went back now it would not be recognizable but it would
  still be Hong Kong.Â </span><br></p>
