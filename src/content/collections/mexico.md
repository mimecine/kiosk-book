body_html: <p>Summer 2006. Two trips for weeks at a time. In DF, hosted by DFC,
  we explored the city and all its markets and could not resist the quesadillas
  from the street or the lard filled bakeries. Got sick. Everywhere we looked it
  was all technicolor and all too good. Even Trotsky made an appearance, Diego
  and Freida too. After some weeks we got in a car and visited several potters
  in Michoacán, a crazy drive with our pals where everything was 5 minutes more
  down the road. Upon return we joined a one-man-band <meta charset="utf-8">on a
  tour of Puebla state, documenting traditional Mexican textiles. Last, we hit
  the road again to Chiapas searching for textiles and ceramics. Amazing finds
  and amazing people.</p>
