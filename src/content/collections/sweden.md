body_html: <p>January 2006. Marco's homeland, he knows it well. It was cold, as
  one would expect. We were mainly in Stockholm but also traveled north to the
  region of Dalarna. Marco tried on Zorn's infamous wolf fur coat while we both
  combed for things in the heart and the soul of Sweden, when we came back we
  were changed and enlightened. Upon return to KIOSK in New York a contemporary
  Swedish craft show soon moved in and a giant burlap elf's foot and boob took
  over the space for a few months. I believe someone took both home to make a
  sofa. No matter how well you know a place there is always more to
  discover.</p>
