  <p>KIOSK is a project about people, places and things founded in New York City
  in 2005 when downtown Manhattan was changing; the interesting, unique places

  <p>At the same time, we were acutely aware that many vernacular, everyday objects were quickly disappearing from the global marketplace, often to be replaced by inferior copies produced at a lesser cost and that bothered us.

And yet, we, along with many of our peers, found these goods to be essential to our work, creation and existence. And so, as KIOSK, we began the process of collecting and showing these common goods that we believe are essential and inspirational to humanity. Within a few months of our founding, the urge to create a place and collect the objects came together at our first location, 95 Spring Street in SoHo, on the second floor.</p>

  <p>Designers, artists, cooks, product developers, writers, accountants, actors, administrators, people across the spectrum, inclusive of all ages and backgrounds, were fast taken with what we were showing and we knew then we were onto something – something that was needed.

KIOSK is a project about people, places and things founded in New York City in 2005 when downtown Manhattan was changing; the interesting, unique places filled with inspiration were disappearing. We felt an urge to fill the void and set out to create a place where people could look, learn, touch and wax on about anything in the world.

At the same time, we were acutely aware that many vernacular, everyday objects were quickly disappearing from the global marketplace, often to be replaced by inferior copies produced at a lesser cost and that bothered us. As independent manufacturers were being undercut and closing, likewise the goods they produced, often filled with inspiration and character as the result of local aesthetics and needs, were falling to the wayside. And yet, we, along with many of our peers, found these goods to be essential to our work, creation and existence. And so, as KIOSK, we began the process of collecting and showing these common goods that we believe are essential and inspirational to humanity. Within a few months of our founding, the urge to create a place and collect the objects came together at our first location, 95 Spring Street in SoHo, on the second floor.

Designers, artists, cooks, product developers, writers, accountants, actors, administrators, people across the spectrum, inclusive of all ages and backgrounds, were fast taken with what we were showing and we knew then we were onto something – something that was needed. Over time we increasingly understood there is a very real thread in common, basic things; that everyday utilitarian objects are symbols of inclusion, free of cultural, geographical and economical boundaries. They are objects that unite, neutralize and bring people together; they engage, start conversations; bring joy; they change views.  
  
The KIOSK archive today is the product of many people's efforts over time.
