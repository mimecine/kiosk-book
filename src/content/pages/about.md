  <p>KIOSK was founded in 2005 in New York City. We create projects which relate
  and respond to locations. We use objects, artworks and artifacts as our
  medium. Past installations have included a number of locations in New York
  City, including MoMA PS1, a collection of objects at the Hammer Museum and the
  ICA in London and a series of exhibitions devoted to art and design at the
  Cité Radieuse in Marseille, France. Searching to show expressions of
  creativity in numerous forms, we expose works with the singular goal of
  encouraging people to stop, look and absorb the beauty surrounding them,
  ranging from the very common to the very rare.</p>

  <p>When we first opened, downtown Manhattan was changing; the interesting,
  unique places filled with inspiration were quickly disappearing. We felt an
  urge to fill the void, to fill a social need. We decided to create a place
  where people could look, learn, touch, and talk about what we were showing,
  while also feeling free to wax on about anything in the world.</p>

  <p>From the start we made a decision to be self-sustaining and KIOSK operated
  as a store to fund our process. That store continues today online.  Over time
  our project has grown but the format for our work is very simple: we research,
  go to a place and search for the things we show; meeting and speaking to
  people along the way. We present things in an exhibition format and when it
  suits, sell our finds to fund the next project. Easy. We believe everything
  tells a story and everything we show opens a conversation.</p>

  <p>KIOSK has been thought of as a shop by some, a museum by others; an art
  installation, a gallery. Almost everyone on their first visit says, “What is
  this place?” To us, it is always just “KIOSK”: our studio, a store, an
  installation, a happening, a workshop, our office, a party, a whatever. We
  never completely define our work: in that sense, the project is constantly
  changing. The ongoing common denominator is to show. The overriding goal: to
  share.</p>

  <p>At the beginning we concentrated entirely on objects we found
  while traveling and chose to support independent producers.  Using those
  objects we created installations that reflected our experience in the place as
  well as wrote a text for every item. We continue to search for objects and
  over time our collection of material culture has formed an archive of 1500+
  items and continues to grow. </p>

  <p>We share what we collect to encourage every person to go out, meet, talk,
  learn, see and show. You don’t have to travel far; look up, down and around…
  when you open your eyes fascination is everywhere.</p>

  <p>We think the best way to learn about KIOSK is to read what others have to
  say, their thoughts are below. If you have an opinion or thought for us,
  please be in touch, it would be great to hear from you.</p>

  <p><span><em>"The world is huge and hard to grasp, but Kiosk made me feel
  connected to other places and people through the carefully selected
  materialization of thoughts and ideas that they had in their store. They
  heightened my sensitivity to how things are made and who makes them. Every
  time I use the Kiosk objects I feel this intimate relationship with the world.
  "</em><br></span>-B.R<br><br><em>"Each object in a KIOSK collection becomes a
  story, of how that object was found, what it means to its place of origin, how
  it’s used, and how it’s made. With each answer comes its own narrative, of the
  people responding to these questions, of their life and their relationship to
  the object. This work is as invaluable as it is rare. Among the many great
  things that KIOSK is, perhaps what makes it most significant is that it is an
  unprecedented document of international vernacular design and a platform for
  independent production—both makers and things—the value of which would
  otherwise be overlooked or unappreciated."</em></p>

KIOSK was founded in 2005 in New York City. We create projects which relate and respond to locations. We use objects, artworks and artifacts as our medium. Past installations have included a number of locations in New York City, including MoMA PS1, a collection of objects at the Hammer Museum and the ICA in London and a series of exhibitions devoted to art and design at the Cité Radieuse in Marseille, France. Searching to show expressions of creativity in numerous forms, we expose works with the singular goal of encouraging people to stop, look and absorb the beauty surrounding them, ranging from the very common to the very rare.

When we first opened, downtown Manhattan was changing; the interesting, unique places filled with inspiration were quickly disappearing. We felt an urge to fill the void, to fill a social need. We decided to create a place where people could look, learn, touch, and talk about what we were showing, while also feeling free to wax on about anything in the world.

From the start we made a decision to be self-sustaining and KIOSK operated as a store to fund our process.

What I've always loved about it is how each of these objects—which are beautiful or funny or fascinating on their own—helps to tell a story, or a series of stories, the likes of which, if you were to read enough of them, could tell you the whole history of the entire world. So it's like Borges's Book of Sand, but made up of stuff that's been fashioned by hand by an old man in Japan or made in a last-of-its-kind factory in Portugal: An infinite short-story collection you could get lost in forever."_

_"Kiosk is the way globalization should have worked - two people traveling the world and bringing back the goods to share with their friends."_

_"Kiosk- for easy access to the essential strata of our collective memory five and dime."_

_"The first time I came across Kiosk, it gave me faith in the modern commercial experience again. Measured but not precious, lighthearted but never gimmicky. Useful! They sold things I both wanted and often actually needed. I always wished they had groceries too. Their environment in New York exuded resourcefulness, curiosity, experimentation and great taste and was a complete reflection of the wonderful people that made it just so, Alisa and Marco. I really miss Kiosk!!!"_

_"Kiosk has the ability to remind you how extra ordinary the ordinary can be."_

_"Kiosk is a huge inspiration to me, please pay Alisa and Marco a realistic fee!"_

_"A selection that lives, grows and changes over time. Picked out by witty eyes and caring hands."_

_"Whether it’s obscure Scandinavian sweets, a Japanese switchblade, or a spool of kaleidoscopic Romanian rope, Kiosk is a receptacle of soon-to-be essential items you never knew you needed."_

_"KIOSK is the living embodiment of William Morris' dictum 'Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful'."_

_"__KIOSK is a curated exhibition of unexpected artifacts, each pinned with its own story._

_"Kiosk is wonderful nonsense in the world of commerce."_

_"Kiosk is a place where I once saw Alex Zucker lying on the floor looking at the ceiling while listening to a poetry reading."_

_"Ever since discovering the magical grotto that was Kiosk at 95 Spring Street (thanks in part to the mysterious DIY signage on an otherwise swanky/souless block), I’ve been constantly amazed at the eye with which Alisa and Marco transform humble everyday objects into articles of aesthetic veneration."_

\-J.C _(another one)_

_"Kiosk is a cultural project of the Everyday; an exercise in mindfulness through appreciation of household objects. Sourced with a keen eye, catalogued with wry humor, and traded with love: Alisa and Marco have panned for the treasure of the vernacular, and gifted their research to we curious. Each piece they sell hums a quiet tune of its own, and all together their cumulative sound is a lovely Song of Life._ _For anyone who can't walk past a foreign hardware store, or has crossed their fingers that their sugar bowl in a Greek pension came from the shop next door, Kiosk is as important as the Quai Branlys..And they give great parties!"_

_“Think globalization is making the world more predictable, boring, samey? Kiosk makes you think again."

_"The creative vision for the platform was so impeccable from the get go. The travels, their studio time for anthropological experimentation and the search for great local production. The physical store, their installation space where objects and their stories would come together to create new life. I loved every part of it."  
_\-P.N  
  
_"Alisa and Marco have the rare and exquisite ability to present an everyday object in a way that it opens up a new world to you (and a glimpse to their own). The way they scout and carefully select objects, you had no idea you desired, is remarkable."  
\-_S.S  
  
_"Kiosk is an escape from the mundane, a journey to a far away place, a tactile meditation on ingenuity and culture."

"_Inspiring creative energy in the most perfect tandem with incredible community energy."  
_\-M.M  
  
_"Kiosk is more than a store. Kiosk recovers the integrity of often very banal objects, like a bottle-opener or an onion basket, building relationships to the everyday-object and the everyday and by doing so making legible the conditions and the history of the objects that surround us and how standardized many of them have become."  
_\-S.K  
  
_"Kiosk traffics in sublime sleuthing for the super ordinary, an instant global bazaar for cultural resonance and artefactual fancy for you, for me, for us for all."  
_\-J.B  
  
_"Visiting Kiosk is like taking a trip to a foreign land. When I travel I visit supermarkets and hardware stores to see what everyday goods are like in other countries. Like Kiosk's selections from particular countries, this gives me a window into different cultures and customs. Over the years, I've assembled a short list of all-time favorite Kiosk products that I like to use every day: the Italian wire trivet, the woven wood Japanese cat toy, and the Shaker broom. When I use these objects, I can transport myself, just for a few minutes, to a far away land."
