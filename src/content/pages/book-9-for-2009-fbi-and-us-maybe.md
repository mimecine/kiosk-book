  data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Our good friend Jonathan introduced us to
  the Bread &amp; Puppet theater from Vermont, where he had spent a few summers
  as a kid. They put up great theater with … puppets, and at the end of the
  performances they … break bread with the audience. Served with garlic soup.
  Every time. It’s something to be seen and experienced. The driving force,
  Peter (at least he was The Man in front of  Elka, his wife - but I can’t
  really tell) has already passed so I am hoping they are still around when you
  visit. </span></p>

  let me tell you the actual story. So, thanks to Jonathan, we arranged for a
  night of talks with people from B&amp;P (don’t ever tell them I wrote it like
  that). Talks were good - I heard since I was not hearing much as I was tooling
  around trying to be a good host - and bread was broken. </span></p>

  bread and soup with anyone - just like that! No cash required. The Communist
