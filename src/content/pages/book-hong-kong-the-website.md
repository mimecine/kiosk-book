  <p>At first, I wasn’t part of KIOSK. Alisa, Ross, and Keetja were supposed to
  do the store and I was just tasked with developing the website. In 2006,
  e-commerce was still in its infancy - some big stores had it, and the smaller
  shops only had the “inquire about” type. I had been working as a web developer
  since -97, so I knew there was a way.</p>

  <p><br><br>I started evaluating the very few open source options out there,
  and landed on OsCommerce. It was the only one to have features such as
  calculating tax and shipping, which I saw as a requirement for sane internet
  shopping. I had rented a linux server ij the cloud (not sure it was called the
  cloud at that point, but it’s exactly what it was) and started to kick the
  tires. It was a steep slope to learn this beast, but I concluded I could do
  it, so OsCommerce it was.<br><br>For the design, I wanted it to use standard
  fonts so we didn’t have to use the - at the time - common   practice of
  generating titles and headlines in Photoshop just to have a fancy font, so
  Helvetica and Courier was a given. Comic Sans was considered for a few seconds
  - at that time it wasn’t the butt of all jokes yet. Lucky us for not choosing
  it in the end! The site wouldn’t be cool until 2012!  <br><br>Colors were an
  easier decision. We were supposed to be no-frills, so basic colors - red,
  green, blue, magenta, and yellow. Nah, we skipped yellow as you can’t ever see
  it on white. Green is a little difficult, so we used it sparingly. I knew
  magenta hurt your eyes a bit, but heck, it fit in the palette.<br><br>We all
  liked grids, and I had made a nice site for Alisa with an image cut into
  perfect bordered squares separated by a gutter, so that was what we all
  wanted. Besides, square images would be ok on both desktops and mobile phones.
  Back in the day I had made a few mobile websites, even for flip-phones (I
  don’t think many visited those, but they were made so the web agency I worked
  for could claim to be cutting edge). The design was settled. Logo in bold
  Helvetica. Simple and effective. KIOSK. Actually, PC’s rendered Arial, but
  that was close enough that only real font nerds would notice - and if they
  didn’t know it was supposed to be Helvetica, how could they
  know. <br><br>Implementing this design and the functionality was no easy feat.
  OsCommerce was a pure hell when it came to customizing the theme, but I went
  through the fire and came out with non-lethal burns. The other features were
  worse yet - I lost two fingers that later grew back. In order to “install”
  these features, you had instructions to copy and paste code at, say, line 420
  in hard-to-find-file.php and when you added the next feature, you had to do
  some math as to know what line to paste that code. Of course all line numbers
  had shifted from the previous paste. Yeah, hot hell. I’m fine
  now. <br><br>This soupy solution worked in the end and looked decent, even
  nice. We could start adding things and sell online! Off to the races. We even
  had it ready for the launch of KIOSK. I can’t recall if it was me who hit the
  target deadline for once or if we waited for the website in order to launch
  our endeavour, but it happened. <br><br>Once in a while, there were security
  patches. I was and still am good at keeping things secure. Those “patches”
  were also just posts in a forum with code to add or change at those
  line-numbers, so it could easily take a day or two to apply them. <br><br>But
  one day we were struck by lightning. I found a file that wasn’t supposed to be
  there. “Don’t you need Viagra?” it said - I’m paraphrasing. It was clear we
  had been hacked! Quickly I had to shut the site and when I put it back up
  after thorough cleaning, the e-commerce features were taken away. I was not
  going to let any hackers steal credit cards from our customers. In fact, I was
  sleepless over wonders of card numbers already stolen and feared a call from a
  customer or their bank, but no call ever came in. Hopefully, no fraud happened
  on my watch, but it was not for my due diligence. <br><br>Weary of having that
