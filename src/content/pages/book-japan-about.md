  <p>KIOSK was founded in 2005 in New York City. We create projects which relate
  and respond to locations. We use objects, artworks and artifacts as our
  medium. Past installations have included a number of locations in New York
  City, including MoMA PS1, a collection of objects at the Hammer Museum and the
  ICA in London and a series of exhibitions devoted to art and design at the
  Cité Radieuse in Marseille, France. Searching to show expressions of
  creativity in numerous forms, we expose things, <meta charset="utf-8">from the
  very common to the very rare, with the singular goal of encouraging people to
  stop, look and absorb the beauty surrounding them.</p>


  <p>When we first opened, downtown Manhattan was changing; the interesting,
  unique places filled with inspiration were quickly disappearing. We felt an
  urge to fill the void and a social need. We decided to create a place where
  people could look, learn, touch, and talk about what we were showing, while
  also feeling free to wax on about anything in the world.</p>


  <p>From the start we made a decision to be self-sustaining and KIOSK operated
  a physical store for funding. The store continues online today.  Over time it
  has changed, but the format remains very simple: we research, go to a place
  and search for things to show; meeting and speaking to people along the way.
  Then, we present things in an exhibition format and sell our finds to fund the
  next show. Easy. We believe everything tells a story and everything
  we present opens a conversation to bring more conversations and so on.</p>


  <p>KIOSK has been thought of as a shop by some, a museum by others; an art
  installation, a gallery. Almost everyone on their first visit says, “What is
  this place?” To us, it is always just “KIOSK”: our studio, a store, an
  installation, a happening, a workshop, our office, a party, a whatever. We
  never completely define our work: in that sense, the project is constantly
  changing. The ongoing common denominator is to show. The overriding goal: to
  share.</p>


  <p>Since the beginning we have concentrated on objects found while traveling,
  often made by independent producers.  Using those objects we have created
  installations that reflect our experience in the place as well we write a text
  for every item. We continue to search for objects and over time our collection
  of material culture has formed an archive of 1500+ items and continues to
  grow. </p>


  <p>We share what we collect to encourage every person to go out, meet, talk,
  learn, see and show. You don’t have to travel far; look up, down and around…
  when you open your eyes fascination is everywhere.</p>


  <p>We think the best way to learn about KIOSK is to read what others have to
  say, their words are below. If you have an opinion or thought for us, please
  be in touch, it would be great to hear from you.</p>

_"The world is huge and hard to grasp, but Kiosk made me feel connected to other places and people through the carefully selected materialization of thoughts and ideas that they had in their store. They heightened my sensitivity to how things are made and who makes them. Every time I use the Kiosk objects I feel this intimate relationship with the world. "_
