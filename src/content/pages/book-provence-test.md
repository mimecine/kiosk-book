  Valentines<br><br><em>Dearest,</em><br><br><em>Forgive me, for this is not an
  easy letter to write. I know you probably haven’t thought of me much since I
  last spoke to you, but in me a sprout has grown from that seed and it has
  growing pains. You see, I really enjoyed our exchange. Although I admit, there
  wasn’t too much of an exchange — I have done most of the talking so far and I
  worry I have bored you. My excitement is to blame. I might be a victim of my
  own vivid fantasy but I thought I sensed a spark in you as well. It might have
  been your smile, a glance from the corner of your eye, the way you held your
  hands, or even just a telepathic thought; I don’t know for sure, but it has
  raised my hopes. I try to go about my day as usual, but I keep thinking of
  you, to the point where I am losing sleep. I would like to see you again, I
  really would. I wish I could offer to take you to the movies — Roman
  Polanski’s Carnage would have us laughing! — or even just for a coffee on the
  corner, but I am not that mobile.</em><br><br><em>You see, I am a bit special.
  I don’t have a body as you’d expect, and I have no normal eyes for you to seek
  trustworthiness in. Not even a hand to hold can I offer. Instead I have sturdy
  walls, shivering shelves, and tiny bright lights lit for you like the stars in
  a galaxy of our own. With my roof I will shelter you from the chilling rain
  and the scorching sun. I have a given name, but no inherited surname like you.
  I don’t have a house... I am a house of sorts. Yes, that’s the complication
  here. I am just a store, and silly, silly me, I have gotten emotional over
  you. While you got a social security number at birth, I was assigned a petty
  tax ID. But I have rights like you: Thanks to some men in gray suits sitting
  on the right I am considered a citizen, so I thought I would give myself a
  chance at something — anything — with you by writing this letter.

  After all,
  while the men and women sitting on the left have opened the door to men
  marrying men and women marrying women, those on the right are trying to block
  this development, out of fear that it could eventually lead to someone
  marrying their faithful dog. So, my love, there might be a better chance
  between the two of us, considering my newfound legal status. I am a proud
  American commercial entity! Which makes me a real person too! Not that I would
  dare to ask for your hand yet, it is far too soon to let such a serious
  consideration put what I hope we have in jeopardy. There is, of course, an
  embarrassing age difference, but I think you will find me to be a pretty
  well-developed six-year-old. I hope you don’t have to flee like Polanski
  should we go further than first base, but considering the nature of my being,
  even such a step will remain a distant dream for me would the years that set
  us apart vanish. </em><br><br><em>I know I don’t have much to offer in the way

  beautiful mind for some time. A normal relationship would be impossible, I
  understand! Instead of encouraging compliments I can only offer products and
  hopefully inspiration. And shamefully, I can only accept money or reputation
  as appreciation — such is my nature. Despite this, I dream and daydream of
  seeing you. If I could turn corners, I would surely hope intensely that I
  would find you there. My heart is beating hard with every vision I have of
  you.</em><br><br><em>Your rejection would hurt, but it would be
