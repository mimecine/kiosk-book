  <p><em>We asked what people thought of us, and Sina Sohrab came back with this
  funny and touching writeup.</em></p>

  <p>Like most of the things I’ve come to enjoy, I discovered KIOSK late. I
  arrived just at the wane of the Spring Street salad days, sometime in 2012
  when I moved to New York. As far as my memory serves, there was a neon arrow
  that led to a graffitied staircase that led to a room lined with shelves. I
  remember the display was styled like an exhibition; small objects all lined
  up, often dwarfed by the size of their placards. I think I bought a teapot and
  reluctantly scribbled my email address on a list for a newsletter. <br
  data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Once I started receiving the
  frenetic voice of “Yves,” KIOSK’s would-be shopkeeper (a pseudonym used by
  Marco and Alisa with an accompanying unhinged personality), in my inbox, I
  followed along as they gathered new things and became intermittently homeless
  over the years. Sometimes they would send word of a new location; LaGuardia
  Place, I remember quite clearly; sometimes I would buy something online. It’s
  one of the few newsletters I have not unsubscribed from. <br
  data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">The premise of KIOSK seems
  illusory at best when you hear it; Marco and Alisa live a charmed life
  traveling, finding objects that have some indiscernible value in foreign
  places, and bringing them back to sell in their shop. The funds from the sale
  of the loot from one trip funds the next. It’s a premise that the endless
  accessibility of online shopping and fast globalized shipping systems would
  appear determined to upend, which has somehow weathered nearly 20 years. More
  than likely, this has to do with Marco and Alisa’s exacting composite eye;
  their methods of collecting and presenting; and the nature of the project.<br
  data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Marco and Alisa’s selection is
  regional by the nature of its procurement. Insofar as KIOSK operates as an
  anthropological project, it serves to mine, archive, and proliferate the
  culture of production and consumption specific to each locale. The objects
  they find don’t conform to any particular categories. Sometimes they are
  products of handcraft, sometimes of industrial production; sometimes they are
  old, sometimes new. There are pipe cleaners, worker jackets, steamer baskets,
  miniature calendars, metal clips, coat check labels, fishing lures, lighters,
  whistles, cheese presses, cuckoo clocks… Their sole uniting qualities are that
  they are each from a specific place; notable for their construction, design,
  or human quality; and are not otherwise available where you are. <br
  data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">This last point is worth an
  expansionary tangent: exclusivity is not the objective. KIOSK takes some
  lengths to describe the source and their encounter with the product—you can
  hop a flight to Italy and buy a red tape dispenser yourself, but you can’t do
  it the way they did it. What’s more is that you certainly will find yourself
  in danger of not spotting the exceptionality of the thing in its natural
  habitat; Marco and Alisa’s particular blend of curiosity-cum-mania leads them
  to a selection of objects that the regular flaneur would stroll right past.
  [fn: Some people might call this ‘curatorial prowess,’ but when the subject is
  melamine dishes, packaged yeast, or carpenter’s knives, the phrase falls stiff
  and heavy.]<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">That KIOSK was
  born in New York also holds something of meaning. It follows in the footsteps
  of institutional everyday anthropology projects like MoMA’s defunct annual
  Useful Objects exhibitions from the 1930s and 1940s and the neighborhood
  hole-in-the-wall shops carrying the good stuff, passed down through word of
  mouth—the common theme between the two being affordable, well-selected wares.
  To this end, it is part of a cobbled-together New York tradition of
  resourcefulness, one that faces a sort of perennial existential doom brought
  on by the city’s never-ending obstacles; escalating living costs, real estate
  development, gentrification, you name it. This sentiment was better captured
  in a review of MoMA’s 2016 Greater New York exhibition, in which KIOSK’s
  archive was included when Jonathan T.D. Neil from ArtReview penetratingly
  commented (in an otherwise pretentious tirade): “On the evidence, art making
  and meaning in New York has become a Sisyphean task minus any sense of
  Beckettian perseverance. There is no failing better, there is no failing
  because there is no succeeding, there is just going on.” [fn: Blowing a snot
  bubble, Neil continued: “Whether intentionally or not, [KIOSK’s] 1,303 People
  models an insouciance to the glut of consumer junk that proliferates seemingly
  of its own accord...” I’ll save you his ostentatious tone and just say that he
  goes on to criticize the privilege of travel and the ego in curation too. It’s
  a fair critique, sure, but it makes your eyes roll so far back that your
  brainstem comes into clear view. It disregards any nuance in the project, and
  is just about the laziest list of charges you can levy (which, by the way, can
  be brought against almost any design museum or gallery). To co-opt a line from
  David Foster Wallace, “We already “know” U.S. culture is materialistic. This
  diagnosis…doesn’t engage anybody. What’s engaging and artistically real is,
  taking it as axiomatic that the present is grotesquely materialistic, how is
  it that we as human beings still have the capacity for joy…?” In consideration
  of which I think KIOSK as a project is an apt response for all of the reasons
  mentioned herein. Calling it “an insouciance to the glut of consumer junk” is
  just about as useful and insightful as blowing your nose on your sweater; it
  only makes you seem dull and petulant.] [fn: Neil, Jonathan T.D.. " Greater
  New York." ArtReview, 19 February 2016,

  <p>For KIOSK, going on has been the real challenge. On more than one occasion
  I have received a particularly desperate newsletter, usually in service of
  rehousing their extensive archive or of finding a new home for the shop. Every
  time, Alisa and Marco find a solution and the project continues. In its many
  manifestations, KIOSK has been interchangeably a gallery, a shop, a website,
  an exhibition, and (soon) a book. Today, KIOSK largely exists as an online
  shop, digital archive, and a newsletter.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br
  data-mce-fragment="1">One could credit this survival to their reluctance to
  rigidly define the project of KIOSK. It remains malleable by necessity;
  shaping itself to endure. The closest Aliso and Marco come to articulating
  their goal is when they express an ambition to safeguard “vernacular, everyday
  objects…quickly disappearing from the global marketplace, often to be replaced
  by inferior copies produced at a lesser cost...” [fn: Grifo, Alisa. “About the
  Archive.” KIOSK, https://archive.KIOSKKIOSK.com/pages/about-the-archive.]
  While the sentiment may not be groundbreaking in concept—most museums share
  this same aim—it remains individual in their execution of it—museums only
  serve to preserve, not disseminate, their collections. And this is the point
  that most miss when they examine KIOSK, its unexpected longevity, and its
  straddling of categorization: it confronts today's pervasive materialistic
  culture by leveraging its very framework to preserve what the culture seeks to
  erode. If this indeed is KIOSK's project, it appears infinite, because it
  responds to a seemingly perpetual cultural condition. In other words, KIOSK
  doesn’t end simply because it has no end.</p>
