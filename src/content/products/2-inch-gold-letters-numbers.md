Driving around New England I was stunned by the amount of labeling with vinyl letters I found. "Exercise Daily, Walk with the Lord‚Äù was one of the better ones but names, addresses, destinations abounded. I realized - _wow, people really like to get their message out there__._ Is it a matter of family pride? Or is it about sending a voice into the atmosphere and hoping ET replies? Do YOU exercise daily? Do you have a house or will you put these on a window in your apartment to broadcast out into the ether? The gold makes them luxurious although I am afraid to tell you - the days of luxury are finally on their way out - but hey, if you have to sell the penthouse and move into a trailer, you might as well keep things snazzy and use gold letters rather than plain old black. Made by a family-owned business established in the 1920s. They began by focusing on one thing: decals, and over time have expanded into other related products. However, strictly speaking, they are into signage.
