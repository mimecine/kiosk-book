Ah, what’s that gorgeous smell found all over Greece? Is it the wild thyme, or sage, or just the dried salt in my hair from the sea? Whew, oh no no, what is that wafting over that I smell? Cologne? Natural? Odorous? But it is everywhere! I just finished my fish supper; what is this crossing my nose? Why, naturally, it is the fresh scent of a moist towelette found in every respectable seafood taverna around. Try the red mullet or the minute smelts. Both are very tiny; however, there is no need to splurge on a whole fish, as any little one will do. So tender, eaten head and all, piping hot, simply doused with lemon. Little ones are best after a round of meze \- horta, fava, tomato salad. Need I tell you more? Ah. And don’t even think of eating the lobster, so commonly on offer, as he was likely on your plane - flown in from Canada or Maine. Yes, you are a little greasy at the end, and only these towelettes will do. Smells like Greece.
