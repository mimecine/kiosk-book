When I asked "Why the name?" no one could explain. Why 444? Dial 444 for a good shave? Take 4 blades and 4 soaps and 4 tonics for a close cut? Reading up on 444 I was surprised by all the online chatter; actually I was surprised by all the online shaving forums and obsessive shavers. Many people seem to have their own personal blends for 444. Used alone or mixed into a liquid aftershave, rubbed on straight or blended, in the end it did not matter as the consensus was "Menthol Blast." Your cheeks have been warned: careful, sensitive-skin users! You have got to be tough stuff to take on the 444. Made in a small production by a perfume shop in Porto.
