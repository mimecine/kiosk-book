Don't we all need a good piece of rope? Found at the market in Toluca, the boy selling these was so excited when we bought up his stock as it meant he could go home early for the day. The rope is commonly used for a laundry line and usually can be found in white, blue, or yellow; we never saw it again in this brown. It is strange, as it appears to have been dyed to look natural, like hemp, but a Mexican friend pointed out nothing of the sort is done deliberately to utilitarian objects so it must have been a mistake in the dyeing process. Will we ever know?
