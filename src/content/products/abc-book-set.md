ABC, 1,2,3, literally... three notebooks for three different chance encounters for three different pocket sizes, three different pocketbooks, three different moods and moments. We thought it was pretty pertinent to work with the number three when it came to Hong Kong: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, New Territories. It is just a suggestion but use 1 for your least favorite thing and 3 for your most favorite; life just might feel a bit lighter.
