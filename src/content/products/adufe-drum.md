Between 711 and 1249 Portugal was either occupied entirely or partially by the Moors. As a result, one finds many Moorish influences throughout the country, but predominately in the South. "Southern" defined by some as south of Comibra, the former Portuguese capital, or anywhere south of the Tages, the river that terminates near Lisbon. Even today, some Northerners refer to people in Lisbon as "Moors." The Adufe is a musical instrument that originated in North Africa. The name Adufe comes from the Arabic word “duff” or “deff." During the Middle Ages, this term was used for round- and square-frame drums. In Arabic the definite article “al” added to the word “duf,” becomes “adduf." To use an Adufe one holds it in two hands with one point directed to the sky. It is drummed and shaken simultaneously. Traditionally only women were permitted to play the instrument and it was primarily used in religious processions. Our Adufe is about one-eighth the standard size as it is made for children. No sticks, no external parts, a simple shaking back and forth, up and down, a pleasant noise as well, a handle to carry it with. I was really pleased with this little instrument for kids. Portable, good for rhyme and reason, something we all need to nurture over nature.
