Forgive me, for I am American and my geography is horrible - but until I traveled in Germany, I always forgot it has a northern coast! Yes, it does! This fisherman's raincoat is made for practical use - stylish, yes - designer, no! Reversible so you can have a yellow day and a blue day! Heavy-duty! Good if you get lost in the city so your Mom can find you. Since 1965, this raincoat has been made in Ostfriesland, on the North Sea. It is 100% waterproof.
