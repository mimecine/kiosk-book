Michael Kim does the hard work for us. He scans newspapers on a daily basis, year-round, and clips things. Exactly what he clips is personal. However, from time to time, he self-publishes a book of clippings on one subject. His first title, _Weeping_, was a study in expressions of deep sadness. Due to its natural appeal, the book sold out. His second title, _Bicycles_, is devoted to you know what, and the third title, _Lines_, talks about the monotony of our existence. One does not realize, until reviewing the publications, that his books are in fact a documentation of humanity and man's existence today. Each book is a fascinating meditation on its topic and one person's view of the world at a specific moment in time. When asked to define what he is doing, Michael replied with: "AFTER MODERN HISTORY is a report on world events that re-edits the news of the day by linking together images according to a totally idiosyncratic perspective of pattern recognitions and typologies. AFTER MODERN HISTORY lifts photos from daily newspapers and re-organizes disparate, often atomized subjects into newly imagined affinities."
