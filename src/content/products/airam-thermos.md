Airam, established in 1921, is one of the many Finnish companies that dabble in this and that. Much like Nokia, which beganÂ in paper production in the late 1800s (they diversified when they launched their electronics division in the 60s), Airam produces lighting, flashlights, batteries, thermoses, etc. The thermos' claim to fame is it keeps liquid hot for 24 hours at 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit. As it gets cold in Finland (and Finns are into frozen lake plunges and ice fishing, among other outdoor wintertime sports), I was willing to bet on the Airam. The graphics are pretty nice too. A double glass chamber keeps things warm inside, while the thermos stays cool on the outside. Holds two cups!
