A German punch in the face. No, a German punch in the mouth. A kick in the punch! This very potent toothpaste is made for people with sensitive teeth and is composed of a zillion great ingredients, all of which are natural. As if we would ever carry anything unnatural...anyway, the funny thing is it is a concentrate - it is recommended to use only a drop of the toothpaste, hence the small size of the tube. And should you forget to only use a drop of toothpaste, the taste-explosion will remind you that you have the equivalent of a tablespoon of toothpaste in your mouth. This toothpaste works so well that I am thinking of picking up smoking again to give it a run for its money.
