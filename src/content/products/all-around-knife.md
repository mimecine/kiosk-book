Many of you out there are knife fanatics, having an obscene collection of knives for every event and occasion. However, you can make do with just one knife, unless you are cooking for the masses, and here it is. It's good for: cutting, chopping, spreading, sawing, buttering, etc. It cuts: tomatoes, apples, bread, saucisson, pickles, garlic. It spreads: humus, peanut butter, cow butter, cheese, you name it.  It has a sturdy handle and the right length of blade. The rounded end makes it smart in countless ways. I traveled for weeks with just this knife and although I could have used a larger chopping and a smaller paring at times, this one, single, affordable knife did it all and was in good form at the end.
