Lend a Hand...We all could use a little more help and a little less competition, a little more chiming in than grinding on. With David Arora's amazing guide to western mushrooms, you can learn to identify the Shaggy Mane mushroom, read a medley of mushroom stories, and stockpile cooking tips. If you imagine it and it's related to a mushroom, it's in there. That's real authorship in action. I had never before seen so many mushrooms with happy faces, and I may never again see such a gathering. This country is a beautiful place filled with beautiful people collecting mushrooms of all shapes and sizes. Catch the magic! Mushrooms can be tricky things; we all need a hand in identifying them, just like we all need a walk in the forest. Help your local forest, too. If you see garbage, Lend a Hand and carry some out. It's good for me and it's good for you.
