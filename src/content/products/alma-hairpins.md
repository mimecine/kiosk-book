Alma has always been one of my favorite names; IÂ find it to be really graphically appealing. Apparently the box design has not changed since the '30s. This was one of the products locals recommended when we arrived in Mexico. It is a normal, standard, strait-olde bobby pin, nothing fancy, just a beautiful box design to brighten up your medicine chest. She's a bit glamorous and can you imagine her with her hair down? What a knockout! I'd really like to know why a star is incorporated into so much Mexican graphic design, it's funny because we started stamping our Kiosk cards with stars a few months ago, I guess it's the memory of school days and how you really wanted the star on the paper.
