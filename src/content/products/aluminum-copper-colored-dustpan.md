It's not so much the form itself, although that hood is pretty good, it's the material. Shiny, like a candy wrapper, and made to make things clean and gleen; produced by a company called Range Kleen which got its start in 1971 producing burner covers in Ohio. I believe this item was in my grandparent's basement in New Jersey or that may be a post-construct. In any case, it really doesn't matter. Isn't it a great feeling sometimes when things really don't matter? Sexy curves.
