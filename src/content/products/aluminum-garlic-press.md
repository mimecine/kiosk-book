If salt and pepper are the king and queen of the kitchen, garlic is the president. And not only the president of the Whole States United in America, but the President of France, Germany, Japan, China, Mexico, and every country in the world with a capital less than 60ยบ from the equator. I have a huge crush on garlic and our President too. Personally I could not think of crushing the current president, but I will crush a clove of garlic as intended; a huge crush in my supper squash.
