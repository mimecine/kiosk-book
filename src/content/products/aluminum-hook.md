Over time friends have asked if we ever come across good hooks for the home. Now we have found a hook that holds your things just so. The wide support means no holes in your clothes that would result from a pointy hook. Save your garments and go with a round-and-smooth-style aluminum hook! Aluminum is a big industry in Portugal. Quite some time ago, when most Western manufacturers abandoned aluminum for steel, Portugal couldn't afford the transition. Now that China controls most of the global steel production, almost all Western steel manufacturers are closing down and Portugal enjoys being one of the few with their aluminum factories still operating.
