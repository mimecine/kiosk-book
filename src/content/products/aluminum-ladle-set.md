I'll tell you  
eating soup for 360 days last year -  
it has gotten better now with these ladles.  
One day,  
when I move away from soup,  
I am gonna bring these with me into my  
non-puréed world.  
They have been made since  
1947.  
You know, with time on their side,  
they have to be  
good.  
They arrive to you  
as a pair.
