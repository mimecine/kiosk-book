Is it a starburst or something for mashing potatoes? I have not been to Colombia, but my friend Chris tells me there are tons of potatoes in Colombia. So many I imagine them lining the market streets, like gold, in all sorts of varieties: fried, mashed, cold, hot, salad, sliced, diced...you name it. In my dream about Colombia, I walk down a street of potato and mash my way through the mess of them. Then I sit down and eat them with a little pat of butter. Isn't that cute? I'd like to go to Colombia. Chris swears by this masher, it saved him from starvation on many an evening in Medell√≠n.
