Cold, ah-ah. Fresh, na-na. Hot, cha-cha. A pitcher for making all that yummy, hot and frothy cocoa I hear they drink instead of coffee in Colombia. I have never been to Colombia, but my friend Chris tells me he used to drink a hot cocoa every morning. The climate in Medell√≠n means it is cold in the morning, hot in the day and cool in the evening. Year-round, too. What the pitcher can make warm and frothy in the morning, it can make cold and refreshing in the afternoon. Think of fresh juice stored in this aluminum deep-chiller in the fridge. Versatile. When I get to Colombia, I am going to start with Lulo juice. Hey, with 150 types of fruit grown in Colombia, who knows where to begin, or to end for that matter?
