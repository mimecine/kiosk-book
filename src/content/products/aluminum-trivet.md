Hot tripod! Aluminum trivet to the rescue. Trivets definitely had their moment and now I sense they are coming out of the country stores and back into style. I, for one, was really happy to throw away the old, burnt piece of felt Marco insisted on using and replace it with this copy of an early 20th-century cast-iron unit. Lightweight, hang it on the wall near your stove, better than in the drawer. When I am cooking and the pan is ready to come off the burner I know where my trivet is, in eyes' view. Wide enough and long enough for just about any need. \*Please note aluminumÂ should not go in the dishwasher.
