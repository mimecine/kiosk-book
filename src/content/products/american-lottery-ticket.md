In Sweden this type of lottery is called an "American Lottery" - sounds strange, but the concept is enviably simple. Each ticket on the ring is perforated in the middle so you can easily tear off one side and give it to the loser / winner, keeping the other side attached to the ring. When you have sold out of hope (tickets) the seller breaks open the sealed metal ring and puts the remaining paper stubs in a container for mixing and selecting. In Sweden, you have to apply for a permit to hold a lottery unless you are a registered sports club; therefore you often find lotteries being sold at soccer matches. The ring makes it easy to walk around with. We have heard many comments that this would make a great necklace - in fact, our friend Lucie made one!
