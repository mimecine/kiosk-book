If you like licorice, then you should sample this, it either takes you there or takes you nowhere. Good to know. Great texture, and chewing time is enough to feel gratification but not be bothered. Different licorices are like cow butter and goat butter. If you like one, eat one. If you like both, then switch them up from time to time.
