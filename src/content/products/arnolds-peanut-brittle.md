Nutty the Squirrel says - EAT ARNOLD'S! How can you not love Arnold's from Akron if you know that Nutty loves them! I am also told by Mrs. Arnold herself that Dick Clark is one of their biggest customers - that stuff keeps him going! Mr. Arnold at 83 is still heading up the backroom at Arnold's. Mrs. Arnold is one of the nicest ladies. They must be having a blast over there, whooping it up, making their brittle! Crunchy and sweet, a little bit of salt in the mix, too; it's a strange multivitamin of sorts: fighting old age with every bite of Arnold's - ARNOLD'S FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.
