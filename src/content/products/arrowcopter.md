At Kiosk, we like climbing trees. Here’s another great reason to start climbing. Soars more than 300 feet up, which means a lot of good, healthy climbing - or running, if you’re in a field. The Arrowcopter comes to us from California, land of open spaces and 3D printers. But don’t go getting ideas about making this on a 3D printer. How would you print the wooden launcher? Or the rubber mode of propulsion? Let alone the wide variety of colors?!
