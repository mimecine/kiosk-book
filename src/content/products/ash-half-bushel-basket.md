Such a beautiful basket - but I am sorry to say it is unavailable, so I'll spare you the details on how we went to visit the maker, how he is working in his father-in-law's shop from the 20s on belt-operated machines, how he was a lovely man to talk to, how it took eight emails and numerous calls to get the one basket...why? Half the problem with craft these days is older craftspeople say they enjoy it, but after years of feeling unappreciated they have become bitter and feel they are sacrificing themselves for the preservation of the object. It's such a shame to hear this after months of building a relationship: "Yes, he made two more, but both have been spoken for. Send the basket back if this is a problem, we have orders for the next two years. People are willing to wait \- your call, but I want either the basket or the money by Monday. We are also a small business and work on COD." Wow \- I think she likes Sarah Palin. Sometimes it is good to be reminded: Be nice! Be nice! And also remember to compliment people if you like their stuff \- we all need to hear it!
