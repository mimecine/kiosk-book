There is one thing necessary to know before you go to Greece (it's pretty simple, and it's easy to remember): EVERYONE SMOKES. I mean, they don't just smoke casually - they really go for it. They smoke! God damn it. If you're a smoker, get stoked, because in Greece, you can smoke anywhere, indoors or out. If you are a nonsmoker, accept it, or bring a mask. If you can't stand smoke, cancel your trip now, because you're going to be surrounded by smoke morning, noon, and night. If you think Japan is crazy about smoking, Greece is a whole different league. You may read this, do a quick Google, and say: "Hey! Smoking is not allowed in public places in Greece." Breathe deeply and read what I am about to say: I know, you know, but somehow, THEY don't know. And as I said: God damn it, they don't care. "Cough," said I. "Yippee!" said Marco.
