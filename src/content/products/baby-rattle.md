We met Nicolas more than five years ago at the Saturday market in Apt, France. I was enticed by his potato basket as well as his baby rattle. The rattle consists of seven strands of water willow and seven juniper seeds. The willow grows in a stream near his house. The history of the rattle is not precisely known, but Nicolas was told it was originally given as a baptism gift, with the number 7 representing the seven deadly sins or the seven sacraments. When viewed from the top, one notices the spiral pattern; it can hypnotize. Over time the willow will grow darker. Provence was historically known for its basket making, with Cadenet being the center of production. Now there are very few basket makers left. We're proud to support Nicolas and his work.
