As an avid traveler, I amÂ constantly reading travelogues of any type. Subject is no matter: railroad travel in China, treks over the Khyber pass, surfing in Fuji, and, in the case of "Backcountry Excursions," wood rambles and ramblings. Walt McLaughlin really has a knack for talking about his good times in the woods. He not only gives a straightforward documentation of his trips, recounting all the highs and lows, he also lets us into his inner thoughts and workings. You know, all those tender things we encounter when we commune with nature. Yes, you know what I am talking about, and it's not about where to pee in the woods or how to do it. It's those thoughts that come to you when you are on top of the mountain or swinging up a cliff while gripping onto a chain. It's those "holy shit the world is amazing and what the hell am I doing in this glorious place? What is my role?" moments. Those thoughts and many more are found in "Backcountry Excursions." As far as a travelogue, it was an outer journey into the wilderness and an inner journey into the soul; it made me want to get out there to see the world, but also to get into my own jazz while I am in it.
