Frankly, the name of this product really turns me off. It took a lot to get me to accept it even though the box looks good. But life is not ONLY about looks, and sometimes what one hears has a powerful effect, too. Looks good / sounds good / tastes good, they all go hand in hand. I mean, frankly, I don't have a great association with cow udders and that's what this stuff was originally made for, hence the name Bag Balm. But I broke through to the other side to become a Bag Balm lover, and you can too. Every day we get down to business here at Kiosk: vacuuming, hammering, taping, gluing, paper shredding, coffee making, telephoning, writing to all of you, sweet jesus! These tasks and more take a toll on our hands. They get rough and chapped. "Oh, poor us!" we like to say. Like they say, Bag Balm does the trick. Have some at your office today, too. After all, it's a family business, more than 100 years old.
