YouÂ can pretty well imagine I know nothing about fishing - good guess, right on! But maybe you know a bit and can share some information with me? A bait net is for catching bait, this much I know. It looks good and interesting; you put it in the water with a float (people often use empty white plastic bottles) on each end. Made by Lindeman Oy who has been producing nets since the 20s. The Finns, being forever practical people, were concerned about me using the bait net in Manhattan - would it work? I tried to explain - first, I know nothing about fishing, and second, fishing in Manhattan is difficult and, I wonder - is it healthy? Regardless, do as you like, here are the tech specs on ours: 10mm opening, goes 1.2 m deep, length - 10 m. Put it in water for no more than a few hours. These are quite common in Finland - the " Land of a Thousand Lakes" (187,888 lakes to be more exact). So, if you are going to Finland, bring your kid, your bait net and make sure you know how to swim! Small and portable.
