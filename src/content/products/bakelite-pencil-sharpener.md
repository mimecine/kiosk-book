A recycled material, Duroplast is as strong as steel. The car of the GDR, the Trabant, was made of Duroplast, and thus was the first car made of recycled materials. Also made of Duroplast and designed in the 1950s, the Dux sharpener has two openings: one for fat and one for standard pencils. Need we say more?
