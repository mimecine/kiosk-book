When we found this steamer basket, we both thought, "Wow! Cool basket. What is it for?" Then we each came up with a variety of functions: paper holder, fruit basket, beautiful object for the shelf, tiny dog bed, etc. Over time, we discovered it was technically designed for steaming food. Simply place the basket over a pot with a small amount of water, just as one would with any metal steamer. We can think of a 100 ways to use this basket and are certain you will too. Why not use it to hold business cards, like I do? At the end of the day, this beautiful object can take on as many things as you can fit in it.
