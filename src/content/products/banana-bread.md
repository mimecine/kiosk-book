Banana flavored marzipan covered with a delicate, semi-dark chocolate. Nice bite, good texture. While it dissolved in my mouth I decided I like the cognac flavor better as I am into booze candy, but not everyone is. Banana flavored things are difficult but popular, as a large portion of the population is into banana. I think it’s about being transported to another place and time. From the cold, icy north to the hot, humid tropics. Interesting. Can’t say I would eat it every day, but I can see how I will crave it. I love the yellow wrapper. Perfect color. It lit up the darkness of my bunk bed in Skálanes. It felt a bit weird to eat banana flavor in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by ice and reindeer with some Arctic fox outside. Again, tropical meets Arctic.
