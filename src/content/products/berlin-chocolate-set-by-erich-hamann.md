Established in 1912, the Erich Hamann factory is one of the oldest chocolate works in the world, being housed in a building by Bauhaus icon Johannes Itten. Their shop in downtown Berlin has not changed since 1926. The packaging is the same as it was when the company was founded. You guessed right \- I like tradition, especially when it comes to food. They have the formula right! Our chocolate selection includes a milk chocolate and a bitter chocolate with tea bar.
