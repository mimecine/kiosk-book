Sometimes even opening a can feels too labor intensive...have you ever had one of those days? So why not get this handy wall-mounted can opener? Labor-free and footloose. Designed by a Prince of Sweden - the "Design Prince" Sigvard Bernadotte \- in 1966, itâ€™s been in continuous production ever since. Bernadotte was one of the founders of the Swedish Industrial Designers Society. He is best known for his designs for Georg Jensen but he also designed a range of stacking bowls made by Rosti that Crate & Barrel is notorious for knocking off. Runs like a Volvo and never dies. Comes with hardware.
