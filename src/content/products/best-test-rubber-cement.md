Oh man, a lot can be said for this product. At age five, I never quite understood the reason for the deep joy I felt while brushing paper cement onto my collages. I thought I was just into art. High on life and in an über-creative flow, paper cement loosened up every thought and got the ideas rolling. Pure creativity in action. Comes with the brush in the jar. Handy for paper as it will not wrinkle the surface and it rubs off easily. In production since 1923, the cement has been reformulated for today's health concerns. Acid-free. That comes later in life.
