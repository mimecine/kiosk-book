Bells, flags and whistles aside, this pen is simply one of my best friends. Front pocket, fanny pack, back pocket, clipped to the collar, lying on my desk, in the kitchen drawer, the studio table, down in the laundry, also in the pen jar. Four colors of ink for super obsessive behavior that, truthfully, I often present. Invented in 1970, originally the body of the pen was blue and white; although I am a traditionalist, I covet the red, buying in quantity when in Europe as it can be oddly difficult to find in the United States. This is a cheap item which solves all and makes life very simply, easier.
