The Hercules bell could just as well be called Hanuman, both characters being known for their strength. Which is what the bell is: both physically and aurally… strong. It is also large in diameter. In India, the sound I most often heard was the rickshaw or scooter horn, but there was occasionally a bicycle bell in the distance. It's got to be very loud to compete with the rickshaw roaches. Often I think to myself, which sense helps me recall a place most easily? Is it the sound, the smell, or the sight of the place? What about taste and touch?
