Oh ring-a-ling-a-ding. A dinner bell for all seasons, a doorbell too. Tennyson's poem "Ring Out, Wild Bells" is recited in Swedish on the Swedish Radio every New Year's. It is a haunting and exhilarating piece. In Swedish, it becomes all the more ominous. "Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky, The flying cloud, the frosty light: The year is dying in the night; Ring out, wild bells, and let him die." ETC... On one New Year's, you will find me with this silver bell on the rooftop at Kiosk reciting this poem in English, ringing my bell, and hopefully falling off the roof at the end into a stunt airbag. Let's make sure it is inflated. Look for me at Spring and Broadway facing south.
