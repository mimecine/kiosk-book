Excuse me, dust, beware: the Big Wooly is coming through. Does the name make it a stuffed animal? Lasts forever, established in 1909, still in the same family, using a 24-step process to make a single mop. The founder created all the machines that produce them. What else can I tell you? Dry mops rock. The "Swiffer" dries out your hands and the "Wet Swiffer" hurts pets. The natural lanolin in the wool and the static electricity it creates grab and hold dust. We had a dry mop when I was growing up \- it was bright orange and looked like a Muppet \- I wonder if my sister remembers. Our front closet was often a house of treasures \- kind of like when I first ventured into the attic late one night and found all of our Christmas presents hidden in a closet \- it was a trove of goodies waiting to be had. Great for the house, your imagination and the environment too. I can't remember how I first found this object, but the strange thing was that while we were traveling in Massachusetts, it haunted us, we came across it again and again. Maybe it found us...crap. Made of carpet remnants; use on its own and shake out from time to time. When needed, wash in cold water with a mild soap.
