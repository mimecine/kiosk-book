_Psssss, thump, thump thump._ Whoops, you have a flat. Everyday people like us get flat tires. It's okay. It's normal. It's something we can all talk about openly. Riders on the Tour de France, do they get flats? I wondered, so I did a little research, and found an interesting story. During the 14th leg of the race in 2012, 30 riders got tire punctures (not flats, as I like to say). I was stunned! How can this be? A race plagued with doping issues now has punctures en masse? The culprit was not found, but tacks were discovered, spread along one kilometer of the race. Amazing, no? Limp along with a flat over the Williamsburg Bridge no longer, my friend. No instructions, but everything else you need.
