Confusing—it’s one of my favorites but I never thought of the combination myself. Funny how that can happen. It’s a pretty simple licorice-flavored caramel coated in chocolate. Once I got started I had a hard time stopping, popping them in one after the next. I love the stripes on the bag and that the name clearly derives from the fact they are a great party or board game candy. They’re the type of thing you can suck on slowly or nosh on and down a bag in twenty minutes. Free choice, up to you. We tested them while driving past a “danger” road sign we could not read, right into a black sandstorm. Hætta á sandfoki í vindhvi∂um. Glad I didn’t choke on the Bingo at that terrifying moment.
