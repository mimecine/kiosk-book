Such sweet little things, birds. This box of birdiness is assistance, like AAA for a nest. I have never been to Colombia, but my friend Chris has, and he says in Colombia there is a real bird culture. Many people have caged birds in their homes and a little shelf attached to their porch for feeding the wild birds. It's common to put out a sliced plantain in the morning, and in the afternoon, the leftover lunch rice, or fibers like these for birds in need. Chris placed a small bunch on the bird shelf and they quickly disappeared. He thinks it was perhaps the Loneliness Bird with its long blue tail feathers, or a Miniature Toucan building its home. When I go to Colombia. I am going to look for those birds and find out exactly who is taking the fibers.
