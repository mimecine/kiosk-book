I asked Marco what I could say about the Bird Waterer, as it kind of speaks for itself, and he said "What, the Bird BAR?" Which led to a whole bunch of "Bird Bar" jokes. "No flat-screen TV" "The only sports they show are chicken races" "What kind of nuts do they serve?" "What are birdy pick-up lines at the Bird Bar?" OK, OK, back to work! More like back to the water cooler! (Bird Bar!)
