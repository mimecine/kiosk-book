A birdhouse made from a birch tree. What could provide more natural housing for the lazy bird who won't peck out its own house than a man-made substitute in birch? City people could confuse both birds and neighbors by having one of these outside their window. Imagine having \*real\* early-birds as tenants. Most New Yorkers will never own their own home, but they can own their own birdhouse. You're not bona fide until you own property, so what are you waiting for? No brokers, no mortgage! Every birdhouse is made from a unique birch. M size.
