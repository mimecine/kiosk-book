Look into any Greek cantina, and itâ€™s fairly likely you will find a group of men playing a game called Biriba, a basic, rummy-style card game. Time passes, and frappe after frappe goes by with the turn of the cards. A methodical drumming echoes throughout the room as the players gather and distribute the deck again and again. Notes are marked in a small game book. Messages are passed. Ouzo is brought out later in the day. Time flows. Moments are lost. Games are won. The sun rises and sets, again, and again. Life strolls on.
