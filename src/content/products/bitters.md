Urban Moonshine's Bitters were introduced to us by the great Peter King, a teacher and proponent of tiny houses. We were up north just outside of Enosburgh at Peter's place learning how to frame a house. We were running low on energy so he tossed us some of his daughter's bitters after lunch. A way to get in on the funky, he swears he takes a nip every morning. Good for the digestion... Tasty, with a hint of orange, fennel, and ginger. Ok for making a Pink Gin or a Campbell or for drinking straight as a health remedy. Just remember the name "Bitters," hence not for people who do not like bitter flavor, but very much for people who eat dandelion by the handful. I found it has been a help to me when I crave sugar; the bitter injection kills the craving. Organic.
