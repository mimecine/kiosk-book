Just look at this bucket! Clean black matte finish on the main body, gorgeous colored handle that arches over while in use or folds down surreptitiously when it's just sitting. OK, maybe you think it's just a bucket, but don't tell that to Portuguese construction workers. They don't have a giant machine or huge tubes coming out of the 5th floor to get rid of all that old plaster and rubble. They take it down the stairs like men. Men with buckets. Yes, they may smoke cigarettes while they carry two of these and nod politely at girls when they take their lunch break. But wouldn't you prefer this and them rather than a large tractor in your apartment?
