I am always on the lookout for a good notebook. One can usually find me on the computer, but I always have a good old paper book with me when I am out and about. What did people do prior to 1920 when the first notebook as we know it was invented? I tried "The Palm" when it first launched - forget it! Priced for writing but the paper quality is of drawing standard - exceptional. Made by a stationary team in Berlin.
