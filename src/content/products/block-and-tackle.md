If it wasn't for the engineering toys I had around me as a kid, I probably couldn't swing a hammer as hard onto my thumb as I can today. My blue thumb really didn't like it, but frankly I am glad my parents had the clarity to give me such toys instead of, say...Big Jim action figures (Yankees: think G.I. Joe) - just one random, most ridiculous, toy in fashion during my childhood. I mean, c'mon - those waving hands? Meanwhile, I was solving the world's problems. The toys made by Kraul all have very good intent - educational, mind-bending, thought-provoking and world-problem-solving type intent. Do the kids you know a favor: keep Jim and Joe out of the picture until they grow up, and meet the real ones! Hey, that's America! Oh shucks, you're right...I'm a liberal.
