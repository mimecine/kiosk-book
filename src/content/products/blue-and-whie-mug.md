I have a set of mugs and depending on my mood or what I am drinking, I select one or the other. I know some people use the same coffee mug every day, but I don't. When Chris went to Colombia, he searched for a new mug for my collection. This is what he found. The mug is made in El Carmen, a small town in Antioquia which is centered around Iberian-influenced ceramics. I am going to visit the factory when I go to Colombia. The pattern he chose derives from traditional Iberian motifs and at first glance can read as marbleized enamelware. Very nice, with all that done and said, you might as well know the government of Colombia gifted the Queen of England a set of the town's china and it was painted with the same motif. Chris thought to himself, if it was good enough for the Queen of England, it has to be good enough for picky (rhymes with) old me. Yes, he was right, and I am so demanding I asked him for some plates too. Check it out.
