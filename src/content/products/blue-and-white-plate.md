I have not been to Colombia, but one day I hope to go and meet the maker of this very fine plate made in a small town called El Carmen, a town centered around the production of Iberian-influenced ceramics. So devoted they are to their trade, the townâ€™s seal features a crucifix and a teapot. When my friend Chris went there, he was really impressed with the quality. Good humor of the people, too. Tasteful designs, simple patterns and the right shapes and sizes. The factory has been family-owned for generations and produces everything in-house. The mug and plate are slip-cast and hand-painted by one woman who specializes in the motif. You can read some more about this place when you read about the matching mug. When Chris sent me the mug from Colombia, me being lovely me, after saying thank you and how much I adore it, I asked him to please find me some matching plates too. You know, because that's the way I am. Rather than Chris telling me to come on down to Colombia and find them myself, he obliged and sent me this plate for my morning toast or afternoon sandwich. It's kind of lucky for him he did send me a plate, but unlucky for me as I still have not been to Colombia. That, you call a "Catch-22."
