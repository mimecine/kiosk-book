Skummis were first created in 2000 by Anna Hökerberg. They took off immediately in child-driven Sweden and have not slowed down since! In Swedish, skummis means “a crook,” but skum means “foam,” so I guess these are “foam crooks”? We have tested them out on our resident baby and he likes to throw them around; he does not talk yet so we don't REALLY know what he thinks, but he tends to smile when he is throwing them. They wrap around little babies’ middles as seated support to lean on. For adults, they are a good alternative to the grey blow-up pillows used on airplanes. In that respect they make a good conversation piece.
