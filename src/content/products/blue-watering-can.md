Blue, the color not found in food. Purple, red, orange, green, every other color but blue. Why? Blueberries are not blue; no, they are not blue. A blue watering can to water all your pretty plants and flowers. Blue, not found in food, watering can to care for your nature. Blue watering can, yin and yang, blue.
