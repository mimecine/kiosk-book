One must understand, in France, cheese is a baby. It is treated with care, love, appreciation; handled tenderly with respect. Nurtured and formed, with patience, so that it evolves. Some cheese makers you can say, educate their cheese. As with a tender baby, the cheese needs a delicate place to sleep. Now, leaving the baby analogy behind, so that this story does not become too gruesome, we return to the boite. The boite is made to hold the delicate yet very, very smelly camembert. The lid turns so that a piece of the box is against the cut edge at all times for perfect preservation, turning, turning as you cut your way through. The cheese becomes smaller and smaller, the lid turns and turns until you are left with alas, perhaps only one last perfect slice. Naturally, to be used with any cheese, as one wishes, in the case that camembert is not your calling. The reality is, outside of France this box may not get much use, however, it is simply, the perfect thing for those of us who care about cheese. Oh yes, I care!
