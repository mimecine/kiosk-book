Bontan,  
the largest of citrus fruits,  
was made into a chewy, citrus delight  
called  
_Bontan Ame_ in 1926 in Kagoshima  
and it has not changed since.  
Kagoshima prefecture is famous for Bontan  
so it makes sense Bontan Ame comes from Kagoshima.  
This delicious morsel  
is wrapped in rice paper,  
edible paper you are never sure  
if you can eat or not \-  
for me, the picture on the cover  
makes me think  
of all of those beautiful, picture-perfect fruits in the groceries in Japan.  
How can you cut those things?  
As an American  
I can not,  
but I am sure  
the Japanese have found a way to cut the fruit and do it justice.
