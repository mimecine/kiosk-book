Got books? Still read? Then you clearly need bookends! For years, I bought the black minimal variants from Staples. Nothing to them. I was never 100% on about them, but never off either. Then, suddenly, life supplied one of those little revelatory moments. The type of moment when you meet the person(s) you are going to marry, or when you see your nephew newly-born, or when you decide to sell all of your possessions and you sell the very last thing. It's one hell of a moment. I saw red. They come as a pair. COMING IN SOON!
