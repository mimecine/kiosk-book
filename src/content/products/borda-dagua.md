First published in 1929 by the Lisbon firm Editorial Minerva, Borda d'Agua means "Near the Water," as it was most commonly sold near the water, naturally, as ports were and are a major hub of activity in Portugal. Venturing by boat is in the Portuguese blood, the Portuguese like the sea, no fear. End of the world, what end of the world! Very pragmatic. Borda d'Agua is akin to the American Farmer's Almanac. It reminds you of special days, gives agricultural advice, advises on moon cycles, small recipes or tricks and weather forecasts. All those things you need in the modern world. A popular item, that has often been replicated, do not accept copycats! Look for the red horseshoe over the man's hat. Even if you cannot read Portuguese, I mean, I can't, it's an excellent piece of graphic design. Someone please tell me, who's the fat guy on the cover? 2010 edition for next year.
