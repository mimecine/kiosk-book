Delicious. Special. A bit expensive, fois-gras of the sea. Poutargue or boutargue in French, no relationship to a potato. Slightly off-putting and then addictive. Midnight cravings in small bites, sliced very thin, with some olive oil on the top, chewed together with a small piece of baguette, a Prosecco on the side. Taken on its own in thicker slices, straight-up. Best way, in my opinion, is sliced thin and marinated in oil with rosemary and lemon, or orange and juniper for 1 hour before stirring the blend into warm linguine, always adding in a little water from the pot. This piece will serve 8 served in such a way. Keep some aside to grate on the top at the end. A traditional Mediterranean food, the Italians claim they invented it, the French say they did, the Greeks too. History will never let us know. The good news is it's delicious. The bad news is I have to send the inventory to the USA, it belongs here with me. Concentrated and with a bite. Ours comes from a producer in Martigues, just close to Marseille. In the final image you see our provider, Boutargue Meyer.

 _Please note, due to summer planning, this is now available only to order for orders made by July 21st and will arrive by the end of July._
