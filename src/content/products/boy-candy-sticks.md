Crack me open and you will find  
a little little little face  
of a  
little little boy inside.  
This little boy is Kintaro  
from Japanese folklore,  
he has super-human strength  
and this has super-human amounts of sugar.  
A friend told me her brother claimed it was poison  
and until she was 13, she believed him!
