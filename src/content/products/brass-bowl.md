The Karahi is very similar to the wok, a cooking tool you might be more familiar with. A cross between a frying pan and a pot, to be used on a gas stove, it does not work well with an electric burner. Now, if you don't cook yummy Indian food or if you just don't cook, then it makes a very lovely fruit bowl. So do not despair. The hammered surface dips and dives around the fruit gracefully. "A single blow of a blacksmith is equal to a hundred blows of a goldsmith." - Indian proverb.
