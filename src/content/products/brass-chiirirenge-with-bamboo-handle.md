A brass serving spoon created to be used with the famous Kyoto-style tofu stews. Made by a 400-year-old company in Kyoto well known throughout Japan for its knives and cookware. The spoon is entirely handmade and produced on a limited basis. Each has the mark of its maker hammered onto the backside. The craftsmanship applied in creating the spoon demonstrates a lifelong practice and consideration. When balanced correctly on a flat surface, the spoon sits upright. It does not get much better.
