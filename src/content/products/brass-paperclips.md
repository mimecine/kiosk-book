My first thought when writing about a paperclip was, "What is there to write about a paperclip?" It holds paper together. Who cares? But then I decided to go on a little field trip to Staples. A very helpful salesperson asked me if I needed any assistance, so I held up the Swedish paperclip and asked, "Do you have anything like this?" He blandly replied, "Aisle 1 on the right." I said "But look closely, are they anything like this?" He just gave me a look. Sure all paperclips hold paper together, but how about the geometric shape and this elegant rose-gold color? I decided to do a little product testing. The clip can hold up to 19 pieces of paper comfortably, but I suspect it's only meant to hold up to 10. It can withstand the number 2 setting of a fan and when dropped from 6 feet, 6 pieces of paper stayed together. Did you know the first paperclip was invented by a Norwegian? And that Sweden occupied Norway for years? Shame on them, but with a little skewed logic that makes paperclips Swedish.
