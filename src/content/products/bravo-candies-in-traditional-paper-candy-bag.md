Ah, nostalgia once again. "Bravo!" or "Congratulations!" to whomever made the first Bravo candy. The bag has been a Swedish candy bag standard since the famous Saturday godis or "candy" came about in the 30s. In order to moderate childrens’ sugar fixation, Saturday continues to be THE day candy is allowed, although there are cheaters everywhere in the world. While these days kids have a much wider range of candies than Bravo, we nevertheless made our own Lordag Godis bag and offer it to you. Better than Swedish Fish, one of the things Sweden is best known for, the plain Bravo knäck resembles Sugar Babies, you also have raspberry, chocolate, licorice and nut flavors. You know they are tasty, otherwise we would not have carried our 15-pound bag of Bravo back for you.
