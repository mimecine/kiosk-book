Ah yes, Bread and Puppet founder Peter Schumann's woodcut meditations on the past 50 years, assembled here for 2014. As it is with all Peter produces, you can either take the political message in and/or see the work as a beautiful, creative expression. Bread and Puppet is so successful everything they do has an equal measure of both. Great gift for your conservative relatives; perhaps change can happen on their domestic front by the end of 2014. Mr. Schumann has gone beyond the standard calendar notations and highlighted some significant days of the year. Take a look. Here at Kiosk the Bread and Puppet calendar is a fixture behind our desk. Goodbye 2013, Hello sexy 2014!
