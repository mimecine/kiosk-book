We first stocked the Bread and Puppet calendar in 2012 and have had it in our home ever since. It is not only a joy to admire but also grounding.  B & P has given us so much inspiration over the years: how to live, what to consider and how to do in this world. Founded by Peter Schumann and his wife Elka in 1963 they are / were our heroes. Elka passed away in 2021. We miss her in our lives and are thankful we got to know her, she was a force; an amazing, beautiful and inspiring person. Elka introduced the B & P calendar in 1988 and the 2023 calendar is dedicated to her, featuring material associated with and inspired by her story. As with everything the theater does the messages are quite direct and often political. You can either take them in and digest or see the work as simply a beautiful, creative expression. That my friend, is great art, it sits in the rare place where politics meet beauty.  Mr. Schumann has gone far beyond the standard calendar notations and highlighted some significant days of the year. [Elka's story](https://breadandpuppet.org/elka-schumann-in-memoriam) is a life loved and a life lived. Forever in my heart, mind and inspiration, thank you Elka, you showed me and so many others the way to live.
