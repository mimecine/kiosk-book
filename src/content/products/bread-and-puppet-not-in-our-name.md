The expression "Not in Our Name" will forever ring in my ears. In 2002, Marco and I were living in Brussels. We were there on a type of residency and staying for free at an old friend's. She was in France working on a film. As her father was a film producer, he often had directors and editors living over us in his spare pad. While we were there, a team was editing a film for the "Not in Our Name" Project. Over and over again, we heard this slogan at all hours of the night. During the course of our stay, a movement I supported became one I wanted to gag. "Not in Our Name"? Damn right - but please, not at 2 am! Not in my freakin' ears! Such is the life of free accommodations. The whole thing only lasted for a month. Now when I read the slogan, I have a flashback and hear the chanting. I don't feel queasy remembering the sleepless nights. I feel queasy because we can, and still do, chant this slogan with good reason. I don't mind paying taxes, but I do mind how my tax money is being spent in the USA. You can't please 'em all. Bread and Puppet is one hell of a theater company. Check them out.
