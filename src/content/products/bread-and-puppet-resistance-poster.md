Resist Technology. Resist email checking. Resist, America, resist. Oh, dear schoolchildren, resist and run. Run into the wilderness and eat up all the air. Atari was only the beginning. Resist and be free, resist and run and run. Bread and Puppet, one hell of a theater company, check them out. Hand-painted color on print.
