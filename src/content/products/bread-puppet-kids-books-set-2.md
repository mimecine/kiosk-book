Much can be said for Bread and Puppet Theater - a theatrical company, a community of activists and so much more. Politically active, with a position against war of any nature or reason, the company was founded in 1962 in New York City. Moving to Vermont in the 70s, B & P was well known for their annual circus and pageant that took place every year until 1998. Bread and Puppet Press was founded to produce various forms of "cheap art" and to raise money for the company. The founder of Bread and Puppet, Peter Schumann, made each of these books for his children and grandchildren. The stories and lessons are magic. The Bread and Puppet Theater is a necessary element in the American landscape - political protest in the form of puppetry - as their founder has said in so many words: "It is passive to carry a sign with a slogan on it, to be a part of a performance where something is being acted out is an act which is so much bigger." Good stuff for kids to get their brains thinking down an alternative road in their energy-saving cars.
