A brown pot made by Tomomi Mizutani.  
Delicate but earthy.  
It will turn you on.  
Not to be used for sake but  
to be used for sauce,  
even though there is no lid.  
Think of the possibilities of the  
yummy things  
you can fill this pot with and then  
think about holding this pot with  
your yummy things  
inside of it.  
This pot is very special.
