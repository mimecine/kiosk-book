Brunberg kisses are unique. First, unique to Finland because they are sold nowhere else. Second, because they are like no other sweet I have tasted. As we could not visit the factory I suspect a secret recipe is being used. A kiss is a light and fluffy cream filling sitting on a thin meringue-like crust, coated with a delicate layer of chocolate. Somehow strawberry flavor seemed most appropriate to kissing. Likely due to the vast amounts of strawberry lip-gloss I used when I was a kid. Pucker up!
