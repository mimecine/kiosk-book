What is it with me and jigs? I don't fish - although I love looking at fish. Why do jigs speak to me? Every one has a little personality and they are all saying the same thing, "Check me out. Don't cast me in there." Hey, maybe the best ones work so well as they "speak" to the fish. "Look at me, I am so cute and funny, you just HAVE to bite me NOW," or is it, "Hey, hey, follow me, man"? Regardless, Captain Len Roberts loves making them; he's an expert, fishing since he was 3. Right now, he runs fishing tours in the Keys. It's funny - when we were down there I was looking at a lot of jigs, more than I had imagined - they are hypnotic. As the days went by, I started understanding something about the faces on the jigs. I realized they are our vision of what an insect or a squid or a fish would look like if it had human characteristics. I found this odd and started thinking jigs actually are little portraits of what the maker sees when he/she looks at the fish, etc. they are modeling their jig on. So, the best jigs, therefore, must be actually what a human thinks a fish wants to see when they see something they want to eat, or made by a human who is really in touch with fish. Hence, good fishermen make good jigs. A human meets a fish, meets a fish again. Get it? Convoluted and complicated, I think that's why they are so interesting; it's you looking at me and me looking at me back again. Actually, I can't explain it; I just know I am onto something or maybe I am just becoming really obsessed. SIGH.
