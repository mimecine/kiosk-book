Kraul is a German company that makes educational toys. Mind-bending things that stretch the imagination. Like this Bridge Kit that supplies you with the components to make no less than 14 different types of bridges. In the back of the manual each bridge type is defined and examples are given. I can't wait until my nephew is a bit older so we can build them together. Four years is too long so we'll go for it when he hits 8. Those Kraul people, I'm so glad we have their things. It makes me proud to have their "experience life" kits at Kiosk and happy to imagine another child playing with them and learning so much through play about this big, big crazy world. Â Ages 10+
