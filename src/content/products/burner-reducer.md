It won't reduce burns or guarantee a morning coffee unburnt, but it will un-wiggle your wiggle on the burner. It makes sure the tiny coffee maker or milk heater sits stable on the stove. So stable that you might burn your milk or coffee if you don't wiggle a little wiggle. But it's good to decide for yourself when to wiggle! Cheap, sweet and petite!
