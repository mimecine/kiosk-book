The same company has produced these cards on a small scale for the past 250 years. They were originally designed for geisha and maiko (apprentice geisha) as business cards. The owner would write her name in her signature calligraphy and offer it to her visitor as a memento. In Japan, the butterfly is a symbol of a woman's sensitivity, and a beautiful woman wearing a kimono is often compared to a butterfly. We like these cards for place markers, notes, gift cards, etc. Each pack includes twenty cards in an assortment of colors.
