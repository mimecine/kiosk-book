Butterscotch that tastes exactly like the butterscotch I made when I was 8 years old and was going through a taffy, butterscotch, caramel-making phase. Did you go through that too? Boterbabbelaar, as it's called in Dutch, has been produced by the firm J.B. Diesch the same way since 1892 in Zeeland, which is adjacent to Belgium. The tin is almost as good as the sweet.
