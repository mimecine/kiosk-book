They call it "the maverick." It is Arizona's finest - it's prickly and can be touchy; it sticks to its beliefs as much as your fingers and some people call it "wild." Cactus Candy - it tastes sweet, but is oh so spicy. A staple in Arizona - does the little cactus on the cover remind you of you-know-who? All thorns and smiles.
