SWEET, Cajeta (small box in English) is a Mexican confection of caramelized milk that takes its name from the small wooden boxes it is traditionally packed in. It was developed in the city of Celaya in the state of Guanajuato. In Celaya, and eventually the rest of Mexico, the confection of half goat's milk and half cow's milk became known by its package name, but elsewhere, the milk candy is known as leche quemada, dulce de leche, etc. Cajeta is eaten on its own as a sweet, as a spread or filling for breads and pastries, and as a topping for ice cream. This cajeta in a fairly traditional packaging is from the Market of the Candies in Morelia, Michoac√°n. The candy market is well known, so well known by the way it is described I thought we were in the wrong place! It is a tiny market! Nevertheless, this cajeta is good and a really great introduction to the sweet, sweetie, and for your sweet tooth, sugar. Brush, brush your teeth after you eat some Cajeta!
