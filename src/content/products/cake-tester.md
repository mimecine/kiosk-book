Imagine the smell of a fresh-baked cake in the oven. It's hard to imagine anything much better. I had a hunch the people over at Yankee Candle would have thought so too, and yep, there are a number of baked goodies to be sniffed in candle form. Soggy-in-the-center cake can ruin one's entire baking experience. It may smell good, but when it comes to taste! The Pillsbury Doughboy certainly has a smooshy tummy and could use a good cake tester. Pull off one pick at a time and stab delicately at your cake's tummy. Essentially, this object is one cake tester and one zillion toothpicks.
