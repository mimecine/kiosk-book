A metal flint camera lighter with its own stand and detachable strap - who could resist? Push the exposure button and a flame shoots out of the flash. Yes, it is a bit expensive, but solidly built. It looks like the Nikkormat or the Canon A-1, when cameras were cameras, not plastic containers for code. Very limited and possibly not available for much longer due to cost, which is just like a real camera.
