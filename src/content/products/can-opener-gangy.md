Let's open cans and bottles with joyful pleasure of nostalgic design wonderment, shall we? The G-A-N-G-Y is red and oh-so-romantic. Would you be mine, sweetheart? You have no idea what I can cook with a couple of cans and a few good bottles. This is what you want to have if you have no other cooking tools in your kitchen. Cooking is an easy 1, 2, 3 with the G-A-N-G-Y.
