Candied yuzu peel  
made by the best maker of Japanese sweets  
in Tokyo -  
Higashiya.  
This is my opinion only, of course,  
but many seem to agree.  
Perhaps you have been to their location in  
Naka-Meguro?  
Since then they have moved -  
the easiest location to find being  
near Comme des Gar√ßons.  
Sadly, the soft sweets,  
are only good for one day -  
the day of the purchase.  
But luckily, the yuzu can last, so we brought it here  
to New York  
for all of us to enjoy.  
Sour and sweet,  
totally pure and of the best quality.  
Yuzu is a citrus.
