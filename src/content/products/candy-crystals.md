I think one of the most beautiful things one could do is make jewelry out of these crystals that changes as they slowly dissolve, break, chip, etc. I can imagine "stones" set in metal rings, bracelets, tiaras, and necklaces. Not your ordinary candy necklace or big candy "gem" ring. Rock candy originated in India and Persia in the 9th century. Dryden & Palmer, the maker of our candy, was established in 1880. Actually, rock candy was a huge industry until Prohibition, as it was one of two ingredients in the common drink “Rock & Rye.” We had to find a product to represent the Vermont granite industry and the excellent quarry called "Rock of Ages." Factory tours, oh yeah. Marco and Chris unfortunately insisted on sticking to the schedule, and we had to move on and into Vermont. I mean, their quarry is 600 feet deep... They are located in Barre, Vermont, once known as the "granite capital of the world." Rock of Ages and Rock Candy.
