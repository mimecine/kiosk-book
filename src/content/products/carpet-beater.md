How can something so practical be so beautiful? Ross said the shape looks like a Japanese paper decoration. I think it looks like a Celtic knot. I have no idea what the history of the object is but it does seem to be everlasting. I mean, even though carpet beating is fairly out of fashion, the carpet beater is still an amazing thing to admire and enjoy. The design was first produced in the 1800s. While the beater is not exclusive to Finland, the Finnish one is the most beautiful one we have found. Produced by the Visually Disabled Persons Association of Helsinki.
