Called a "Gamela" in Portuguese, made from one piece of wood, chopped into form with a chisel and hammer, hacked away in a sculptural manner. Traditionally used to give shape to bread before it goes into the oven. Portuguese bread is delicious, the bowl has the right vibes. Very large Gamela are used to feed barn animals. I don't eat animals so I can't tell you if Portuguese ones are tasty, although people say they are. Use the bowl for anything you use a bowl for. It looks like something that could be stone but instead was made of wood. Heavy, you could kill someone with it but don't; you want to stay out of jail and keep baking bread until you grow old and can barely lift this thing.
