Cast iron was one of Japan's first technologies—from the late Jomon Period (fourth century B.C. to third century B.C). These pendants are from Iwate, a region rich in iron. The black color is the result of a Japanese lacquer glaze called urushi, which prevents rust. It is unusual to make jewelry out of cast iron metal. The pendant has a nice weight - the chain is a complementary black-oxidized silver. It unclasps allowing you to add on to it - perhaps a white shell or another charm.
