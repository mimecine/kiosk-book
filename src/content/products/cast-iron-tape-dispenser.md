This object is the epitome of anonymous design. It's what a tape dispenser should be: a chunk of iron that stays put. It does not budge when you maneuver with one hand: it's a solid piece of hardware for the desk. After forty-five years of production, it has been dropped from the company's line. It is dead stock - once it is gone, it is gone for good.
