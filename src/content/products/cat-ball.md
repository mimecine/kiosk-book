Cat toy made of yellow and gray felt. No cat-narcotics this time (if you want that, see our Japan picks), but our domestic feline subject had a great time with it. He rolled it back and forth across the room and seemed very happy that it so easily stuck to his claws. Boy, I'm glad I'm not a cat ball.
