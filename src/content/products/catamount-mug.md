Welcome to the world of Catamount Glass. It is a world I have been trying to gain access to for no less than 15 years, and I am happy to share it with you today. It all began when I was interning as a set designer, and one of my first tasks was to comb through a list of US manufacturers of industrial products in a book that Conran's published sometime in the '80s. My job was to go through the list and see which manufacturers were still around, either by calling or sending a postcard. (These were the days before the Internet was in widespread use, not to date myself.) I remember, when the Catamount catalog arrived, I was so taken with their work I proceeded to photocopy it for myself. Years later, when I was going through my old set design files (and tossing most of them out) I came across the Catamount catalog and found it just as interesting as before. At that point I owned Kiosk, and we were just beginning work on our first American collection. I called, they sent me a new catalog, and that was that. Nothing. Five years later we started working on America 4, focusing on things made in Vermont, and I remembered Catamount. We drove up to meet Alain and Paula. Lo and behold! Welcome to a world of invention and creation, a world of glass and a place of progress. A mug of all mugs, it even comes in two sizes. Borosilicate glass means it is easy to see the color of your brew, it won't crack from boiling water, and the handle does not get hot.
