Second came the cedar cutting board.  
Before, I owned only two Teflon boards:  
ONE for fish and ONE for onions.  
For vegetables I had none,  
but I was looking for something...  
maple boards from Vermont are aesthetically lovely,  
but only for cheese and crackers.  
Let's face it.  
When I found this board I knew it was my solution.  
Lightweight, strong, naturally antibacterial,  
it smells good and lasts.  
Heat up your carry-out from Mondriani and fast-chop some garnish  
or cook a whole meal of  
triple-seared steamed greens, quick fried tofu with  
hysterically-prepped cilantro greens.  
Either way  
you are OK.
