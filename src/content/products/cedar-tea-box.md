One older man, Mr. Tsuchiya,  
with help from his wife,  
makes these tea boxes.  
Chabako is what they are called.  
Naturally,  
they are located in the Shizuoka prefecture, known for green tea.  
The box is very beautifully made, but the paper detail sold it to me.  
Each edge is delicately covered.  
Many papers of my own will now be stored in these boxes.  
However, they are good for anything important, or for food stuffs.
