Just look at it! And feel it (sorry internetters). Japanese rice-paste confectioneries would look handsome on this tray as well as almost anything else. Handmade using a traditional wood bending technique. A modern object produced by the owners of Higashiya in Tokyo in conjunction with the craftsmen. Higashiya is one of the best Japanese sweet shops in Tokyo; we suggest you go. We are very pleased to offer their things this Christmas.
