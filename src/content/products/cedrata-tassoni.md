Ah yum! A mysterious, refreshing drink originating in 1793 in a pharmacy in Salò. The company to this day is family owned and run by the great granddaughter of Paolo Amadei who purchased the firm in 1884. An usual concoction made of citrus fruits and cedars from Sicily, Calabria and Puglia, Cedrata Tassoni is fresh and sweet; perfect for summer. A textured bottle that resembles a citrus fruit, much like the original Orangina bottle that I love to hold. The company runs an ad at the start of the warm weather which can be heard ringing throughout the nation, the original and current rendition being sung by Mina. Looking at the spot online I find a number of incarnations of the ad beginning in 1982, this I must look into... but first, it's summer now and I must hop into the car, put Mina Celantano on the radio, pop open a Tassoni and drive. Look out at the fields, see the sea, breathe the air and scream a little. Refreshing. Reach out and touch someone.
