Snap it!  
Precision is regularly on the mind of the Japanese -  
I can dig it.  
This style of chalk line was originally made of cast iron.  
It is very beautiful too, but a bit heavy, no?  
Who knew a green dragon could hold chalk  
to draw a straight line  
to build your studio's walls with?  
It feels good in the hand, much like a onion.
