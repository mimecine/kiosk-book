This "unscented" charcoal soap (it is unscented, but the natural scent of the clay is present, and some people claim it to be addictive!) is enriched with kaolin clay and medicinal carbon powder. The charcoal is a microporous active ingredient, which gently cleanses your pores, while the bentonite allows your skin to retain its natural moisture. Use either on your face or as an all-over body soap.
