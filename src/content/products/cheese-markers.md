Vermont is known for cheese. At Kiosk we don't sell perishables. I don't believe we can, in fact, but we love to eat and we had to give a nod to Vermont cheese and our favorite Vermont cheesemaker, Bonnieview Farm. They simply make the best cheeses around. They are located in the Northeast Kingdom not far from Hardwick, a town that has had a bit of a food revival. Bonnieview is a sheep farm owned and operated by Neil and Kristin Urie. Neil inherited the farm that has been in his family for four generations. Cheesemaking must run in his veins, because their Coomersdale is a "Please Don't Stop the Music" kind of cheese. We visited them for over an hour of kind hospitality while they went about their business. These cheese markers are a nod. In case you don't have a need to label your cheese, they are great for labeling plants in the garden. Write on them with pencil, marking pen (like our Fennia pen), or china marker. You can find Bonnieview cheese in New York City at Saxelby Cheese in the Essex Market.
