Ah, it was just another saga. We headed out from Breb early and soon it was approaching nightfall - a typical day in our wanderings around Romania. Potholes and horse carts and endless detours and stops. Old ladies selling coral mushrooms on the side of the road and driving through herds of cows - large ones with horns. Day upon day and night upon night, we consumed what the road presented us. Here it would feel abnormal, there it was anything goes and we rolled with it. Leaving Cluj late, we had directions to where we were staying, but as it got increasingly remote we began to worry, the light was fading fast. We drove through towns which resembled old mining villages from the 1800s in America. Paved roads turned to mud. I reminded Jason the place was his find, he made a stroke in the air against the evil eye in response. It was getting crazy. Marco was sent into the local bar to find out if we were close. A right, a left, a climb up a rocky path called a road and we arrived at Roger and Zsuzsi's Organic Art Ranch, located in the Apuseni Mountains. So beautiful, so simple...there was no indoor plumbing, it was pretty crunchy. That was OK though. Due to exhaustion and bewilderment, we slowed down fast and listened to our hosts talk about their plans: there was the garden, the apartment they were making in the barn, their work exchange residency program - they believe it is important to check out of business and check into something else. A place to create where they could learn from their guests and share everything they knew - that included cheese making and Roger's cheese press. Generous. A creation in itself. Comes with instructions. You too can make fresh farmer's cheese - add dried herbs and some salt. When I check out of New York, look for me there - it's the place, it's mountains as you want them. You can dream.
