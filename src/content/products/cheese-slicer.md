Slicing cheese and sitting in the woods. Having a picnic after mushrooming one day. Being natural in nature. Eating butter and cheese on a hard cracker. Could things get any better than this? Look at how the sun reflects off the metal! Shine on you crazy diamond. According to the company, the founder Thor Bj√∏rklund invented the cheese slicer, which has been in continuous production since 1925. When something is good, it's good.
