Really, this piece could work wonders on your child. It did for my generation, hours of creativity on my own without electronics, but then Atari stepped in and life was never the same. A friend who is a mom said this is a beautiful thing, but maybe as a design object; she was not certain her child would actually be entertained by its simplicity. Perhaps this is a piece to hang on the wall as decoration, or maybe this is a good gift to give, something parents would never buy for their own child, but they would love to have it for themselves.
