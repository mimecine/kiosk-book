Wow, really cute. A Kwikshop product based on a vintage pair the Berlin-based Kwik team found. Produced by a traditional, small Bavarian leather factory in operation since 1890. These look like a yummy cookie or Hansel and Gretel, depending on how you see it - they did eat a gingerbread house, after all. Hopefully, your child won't find itself in as much trouble! NOTE! The red leather dye does come off on light colors, so please wash before using. Care instructions on attached label, easy maintenance.
