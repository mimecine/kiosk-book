These are simple little cotton ponchos for children aged 2 to 4. We found them in a shop that was selling towels so I assume they are for after the bath but maybe that is my fantasy. Waaaay cooler than a bathrobe. I don't like this style on adults, too much of a high\-school hippie memory, but on little ones I think they are super cool.
