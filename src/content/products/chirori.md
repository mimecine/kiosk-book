Chirori. Sake should not only be cold when it should be cold, or warm when it should be warm, it should be served with and in style. So here is visual and tactile style for your beverage. Temperature control and motor skills are on you. Chirori is made to heat sake in. A modern object produced by the owners of Higashiya in Tokyo in conjunction with a traditional craftsman. Higashiya is one of the best Japanese sweet shops in Tokyo; we suggest you go. We are very pleased to offer their things this Christmas.
