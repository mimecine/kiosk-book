Oh, I am sorry \- not chocolate cigarettes, but chocolate STICKS. They don't look like those naughty fixations, do they? Just a coincidence! Do you know how many Germans smoke? It brought me back to the early 80s and going out to bars and smoking when I was 16 years old \- there were clouds and clouds of smoke. You don't see candy cigs in the States much anymore, maybe there is a correlation between candy ones and the real deal? These goodies could be the reason so many people smoke in Germany! Really cool packaging \- check out Mexico and New York \- there is a little bit of KIOSK in everything you do.
