Christina from the design firm Greece is for Lovers was keen on bringing us to the patisserie Varsos in Kifisia, in a northern suburb of Athens. As I understood it, Kifisia has been a suburban Greek hotspot for some time. You have the bowling alley, youâ€™ve got the park, the cinema, and the Athens Mall, and then you have Varsos, around for the past 120 years. Varsos is technically a bakery and a dairy establishment. This is common in Greece: a place where one can binge on yogurt, rice pudding, a melange of cakes with custard filling, cookies, and chocolates too. Some things take centuries to get right, and we should respect that. In Greece, they know how to make sweets! Dairy does not travel well, but chocolates travel just fine! We decided three of each piece was a good number. Included are: Karioka, with chocolate and walnuts inside; Bul, the round one with chocolate cream filling; and Pastaki, the square one with chocolate cream filling and pain de spain, a kind of sweet bread.
