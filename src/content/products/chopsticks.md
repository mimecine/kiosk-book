Yoshino cedar,  
one of the best cedar forests in Japan.  
Since 1902, this maker has produced these chopsticks with  
this special cedar.  
They also supply the Imperial Household.  
So, if you think for a moment -  
using these chopsticks  
you could be eating, at the same moment,  
with the same thing,  
as the Emperor of Japan.  
Am I allowed to suggest this?
