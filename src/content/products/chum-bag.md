What is chum? If it sounds well, yucky, kind-of greasy...well, it is. Chum is fishing bait usually consisting of oily fish ground up to be tossed around on the water. This bag was made to hold it. No, no, no chum in my bag, however. My very refined chum bag contains only the finest beach necessities and, at the end of the day, as teeny of a bikini I can fit into. Marco's bikini can fit too! After all, what is a chum bag for if not holding chum's dirty bathing suits too? Ew, yucky chummy. But seriously, I think this bag is awesome for the beach. If it can hold chum, it can hold your greasy suntan oil too. It's my pal.
