Ding Ding goes his bell. "Hello, Hello" he says as he tips his hat. Mr. Barossa is on his way to his office and a fright as he forgot his wallet at home. How will he get there on time!? Oh! but there is Nuno's bicycle, I'll just borrow it this one last time and return it tonight! But Nuno has been tricked by Mr. Barossa before, and last time was the last! He very cleverly put a bell on his front tire so when the thief went to ride away he would go Ding Ding Ding. Here is Mr. Barossa with an expression on his face just after the first Ding. What is it that you think he does next? And where is Nuno? Roll Mr. Barossa on the floor to find out!
