Size it up! Step right up. Truly a beautiful object used to size citrus or essentially any other round fruit. When you think about it for a moment - that's a lot of different fruit. Why? The different holes equal different diameters, and also different grades, of fruit. It's interesting to learn about citrus grading. So many things I never thought of, for example, an "80 Box" is based on how many oranges of the same diameter generally fit in a citrus box, which should be 80, but it may be more or less. Did you know that Florida accounts for 1/3 of the worldâ€™s grapefruit production and is only second behind Brazil in terms of oranges grown? That's a lot of sizing plates! Note the "Orchard" label on the front was made with a Dymo label maker and cast in place.
