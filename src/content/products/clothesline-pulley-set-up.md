As man has progressed, so have the habits of clothes drying. Clothes on a rock moved into a tree, to clothes-on-a-line-between-two-trees, to a clothesline, to a "clothestree," to a tumble clothes dryer, and then to a whole drying room (which you may or may not be familiar with) - and now back, hopefully, to a clothesline. If you care about your clothes, a tumble dryer is not the way to go. Also, ditto if you care about your free time and don't prefer to spend it at the laundromat watching the clothes tumble. Lastly, if you care about this great Earth we live on, and saving energy, you should have a clothesline. It pays for itself quickly (if each drying session costs $2, then you are talking about the cost of 12 wash days over 3 months) and your clothes survive longer by avoiding the harsh tumble. In most places the fresh smell is a benefit, as is the lack of pressing needed post-drying. The set comes with two pulleys and 100 feet of line, which equals 50 feet when installed. If you want more line, let us know and we will sort it out for you! The line is a nice emerald green color; we made sure of that. Oh, one last thing: you might wonder why we are including something made in Canada when 'twas a part of our America 4 collection. The truth is, we saw so many of these in Vermont and elsewhere this past summer, and every one of them, old and new, was made by the same Canadian maker. Love thy neighbor, honor thy clothes.
