I love the clear buzz I get from matcha. Coffee works for a pick up but it comes with a fuzz, much like wine. Matcha on the other hand, is transparent and I feel sharp on it; when I am up, I don't have that coffee comedown. It just feels healthy, green vs brown, in terms of color it makes sense. Hot matcha is a delight but out of respect I reserve it for moments when I can give it proper time and care. Cold brew is for the day to day, every day. I show it not enough respect and yet somehow a spoonful and a shake with some ice always comes out just so. Its consistent nature I attribute to using the right cold brew, in my case, Breakaway Matcha out in Marin county, founded by an obsessive matcha fan.  The quality of their matcha is impeccable. Comes in a glass jar, store in the fridge once opened.
