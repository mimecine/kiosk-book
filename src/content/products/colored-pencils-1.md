Doodles - oodles of them. My friend Chris went to Colombia and found these. He tells me double-trouble pencils are commonplace in Colombia. Not here in the United States where two-for-one is not better than one-for-one or even none-for-one. I once had a man make me an offer on the street, "two-for-three or one-for-two." I didn't follow, maybe he was watching too much of his product - blockbuster movies - frankly, I don't get them either. Interesting combinations are the name of the game and with these pencils, it is all in the stripe. When I go to Colombia I am going to look for these pencils and then doodle my way around town.
