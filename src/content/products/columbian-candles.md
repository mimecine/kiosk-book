Turn the lights way down, turn these candles on, after a little while shoosh them out and do whatever you do in the dark. If this is too much for you, simply have a dinner by candlelight. It's not my business what you do, I'm only here to make suggestions and play show and tell. My friend Chris spent many a night without electricity in the old house in Colombia. He told me the power outages only added to the romance of the region. I want to go to Colombia to find that romance - with Marco, of course! Set of 6 assorted colors.
