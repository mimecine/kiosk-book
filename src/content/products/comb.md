Combs are among the oldest tools found by archeologists; the earliest ones were discovered in Persian settlements from 5000 years ago. This comb gives me a 1950s Hong Kong and butterscotch vibe at the same time. What is it with princesses and combs? Have you read the story of "Petronella"? In the 1970s version she used a comb much like this to ditch a suitor. Throwing down the comb, Petronella turned it into a dense forest but then her suitor's head turned into an axe and he cut through the forest to get to her. Trippy... I love that trick but I don't think it's worth trying on some drunk guys in the streets of New York. Forests don't grow on sidewalks, you know
