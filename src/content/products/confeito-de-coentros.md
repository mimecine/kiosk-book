In one way Confeito de Coentros is similar to Indian sweet mixes with coriander seeds and sugar bits. But in appearance they look quite like Konpeitou, the Japanese sweets most famously made by a shop in Kyoto. Both of the references are possible as Portugal occupied Goa, and in 1542 they were the first foreigners to enter Japan. With further research, I discovered the word Konpeitou derives from "confeito" in Portuguese. The Portuguese were the first to translate Japanese into a Western language and, interestingly, some Japanese words derive from Portuguese. Confeito were first brought to Japan by Portuguese merchants as gifts to the Imperial court. At first they were quite rare and valued, as the technique of refining sugar was not known in Japan. Over time, the process was discovered by the Japanese and they began producing their own version. Konpeitou are made with rice kernels in the center.
