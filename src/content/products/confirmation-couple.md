Oddly Finnish people; utterly charming. Made for the confirmation cake, but just as good on the wedding cake. You know, New York Magazine gave us the "Best Place to Buy a Wedding Gift" award, so we have to carry something wedding\- related. When I showed them to Marco he said, "Wow, they are so Finnish." I said, "Yeah, they really are." Don't hate us Finland. We really think these two look good. Options are boy/girl, girl/girl, boy/boy. You choose.
