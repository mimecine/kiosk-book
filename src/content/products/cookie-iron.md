In Romania there are forests like no other forests. You see, unlike ones I am used to here on the east coast, you are often alone - with not a person or a house in view. There are also many carnivorous animals - the largest concentration on the European continent - such as wolves and bears and even lynx. Once you read that, the imagination goes running. Who was it that gnawed off that tree stump and left a tiny nub? Will it go for my ankle next? And as our translator casually mentioned to us - who is he and why are we trusting him? An interesting question when you are driving down a dark, remote road in Romania. But darkness always turns to light. There is something magical in those woods. Take the forest cookie iron and place a ball of dough in each shape (mushroom, acorn, leaf, pinecone and walnut - hence, forest) - madeleine dough works well. One shape makes one side of the cookie. Cook on a burner, turning every 2 minutes until done. Does not take long. Glue the two sides together with cream, nut paste or whatever comes to mind.
