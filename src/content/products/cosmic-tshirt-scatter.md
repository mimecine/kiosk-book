I made it to one Dead show and I consider myself very lucky. I was quite young and I remember the batik wrap skirt I wore, but I can't remember the shirt. I know I had one on and not everyone did. I remember all the funky things people were selling and I remember I smoked weed but I took no hallucinogens, honestly. I don't recall if my parents knew where I was going and I think we were at the Meadowlands Arena. I remember walking up to the Arena and thinking, "Oh, those are Deadheads, cool," and wondering where they showered. The story continues on the next t-shirt.
