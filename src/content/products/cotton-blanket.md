My yoga teacher assured me if I were to have these blankets at Kiosk, they would do well and everyone would be happy. So far, everyone who has encountered this blanket has been happy. Perhaps the thought of being wrapped in pure cotton coziness makes you happy? Or the idea of Supta Baddha Konasana with this blanket under your head makes you happy? It should. I hope it does.
