My friend in Berlin used to send these to me. Americans are obsessed with plastic grocery bags, do you know how much waste their habit creates? Globally, factories churn out 4-5 TRILLION bags, ranging from garbage bags to grocery bags, in 2002. The best thing is - carry your own bag. I think we need to bring back the 70s ad campaign - where is that owl when we need him? "Give a Hoot, don't Pollute! Don't be a Dirty Bird!"
