Envelopes for giving money  
to show your appreciation.  
To give money alone  
is too obvious  
and also uncouth.  
The Red-Crowned Crane in Japan  
is a symbol of luck, longevity and fidelity.  
It is as tall as me and  
it is said to live for a 1,000 years.  
In terms of the message it gives  
when combined with money -  
I feel this is very positive.
