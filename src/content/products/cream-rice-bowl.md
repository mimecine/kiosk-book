When I was in Japan  
I often wondered while eating rice  
and pouring instant green tea into my tea cup  
and nibbling on my nori packet  
and gazing at the Shibuya skyline -  
how good is this?  
Japanese breakfast.  
I know Krispy Kreme has now left New York  
and landed in Tokyo.  
Donuts bring a novelty  
but soon,  
one day, the Japanese will get over it  
and return to their rice in the morning.  
Perhaps after H & H bagel lands too,  
much to Mike's happiness,  
and this rice bowl made by Yamanobe Takashi  
will be waiting for them.  
Until then...  
I gaze out over my Krispy Kreme-free landscape  
and eat rice.
