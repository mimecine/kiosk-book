The crowbar - every country makes one with its own subtle signature and one purpose - prying. Whether casual prying or emergency prying, you want to make sure you have one of these handy for the day you need to do a bit of prying. This is a great gift for the person who has everything because they probably donâ€™t have one of these in their car - a place heavily loaded with prying potential.
