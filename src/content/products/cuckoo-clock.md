A perfect little cuckoo to remind you of hours passing by - hand-carved by a 60-year-old firm in the middle of Black Forest, authentic in the way Germans can do. Interestingly, it contains a mechanism that has largely gone unchanged since the middle of the 18th century. Although it is often believed the Swiss invented the cuckoo clock, this is not the case - the concept was first invented in the Black Forest. I wish it had an alarm setting - what a pretty way to start the day.
