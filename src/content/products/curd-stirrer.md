An ode to chaas: buttermilk made spicy with chopped green chili, cumin, salt and perhaps some cilantro - a cold drink without sugar, worshipped with ice - but not for most of you, if you are in India. When it is hot, I drink two glasses between breakfast and dinner. I have breakfast early, before the sun rises, and dinner after the sun sets. Then a nap has to be in-between. To head into the transfixed-nap state of being, I churn some chaas with a madhani (a curd stirrer). Rub it between your hands so it resembles a mixer blade in motion. Good for pounding garlic and ginger too - I use it for any mashed thing and just made apple sauce with it this morning. A good pounding/mashing tool for in the kitchen.
