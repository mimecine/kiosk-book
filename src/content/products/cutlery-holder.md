I estimate I do dishes 1.5 hours almost every day, hand washing, no machine. This is a major activity. More than I devote to exercise. How about you? Where is the joy? Do you find it at that soapy sink. Man, I hope you use our Danish dish brush to get by. If not have a look at that when you are done reading this. How about that metal basket or cup you drop your cutlery into with a clang? How is that on the nerves? I can't say I enjoy that rattling sound. And what about when the misbalanced weight of the cutlery, etc tosses the whole jazz off balance and tips it over, clean stuff and all, onto the dirty counter or better yet, tips over the whole damn rack? I have had that happen too. With all this suffering I started searching. It's worth it as 365+ hours a year is a good chunk. A chunk of my short life even! What can I say? This holder, it solved a lot of my problems so I can focus on sweeter thoughts when I am standing in suds at the beginning, middle and end of every day. I like the colors too. Note there are no holes in the bottom which is a bit bothersome however the center ring pops out easily for simple cleaning
