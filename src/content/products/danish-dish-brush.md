JUST THE BEST. Durable. Superfine. Your plates, your glasses, have earned it! Over time, many people have shown us all sorts of things from their closets, cabinets, bookshelves, etc., and we like it. We love it! MANY HAPPY CUSTOMERS The Danish Dish Brush was presented to us by a friend who travels every summer to the south of Sweden with her family. Year after year, while on holiday, they have developed a tradition of making a pilgrimage to Denmark to purchase one brush for every adult in the family. The brush is “that good”. Our pal not only clued us in, but she gave us one, and after we tried it for a length of time, we decided, it passes the test, it is, THAT good. In general, our at home brush lasts between 2 - 3 years. Sometimes certain materials, melted cheese, bread dough, etc., get stuck in the bristles. If that is the case, when your brush needs cleaning, dip it into a pot of boiling water and hold it there for a couple of minutes, it should clear out. ADDED BONUS! The horsehair holds soap really well, so now I tend to use one-third of what I did with plastic brushes, plus I don’t get sprayed with soapy water by those hard bristles any longer! TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT.
