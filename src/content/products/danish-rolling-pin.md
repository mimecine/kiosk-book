It takes a lot to make something as well as your grandmother, and your sister too. You wonder why things never turn out just as they made or make them. You have the same tools: the cookie press, the baking sheet, even the rolling pin. It's wrapped in the same cloth. The recipe is written in her hand. Why the difference? She baked identical things in different ovens over the years, and they consistently tasted the same. Better than yours. Over time you understand it's the compounding of their life experience that adds up into the end product, the end goal, THE ONE. There is no way of making the same. So you move on. You find your own habits. Yours take on a different taste, maybe an even better one. Over time the flavor of hers fades, and yours comes into greater view. There is no need to think back. Be in the present. Be with it now. Get your own tools. This should help.
