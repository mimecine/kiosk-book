The guys at Kiosk insisted we stock these mittens. I was surprised as I thought guys generally wore gloves, not mittens. But then again, I was wrong. I think it is something about these mittens; they act as a kind of a security blanket. Take a look. (They do resemble a stuffed animal.) Wearing them is like carrying around a teddy bear, but you are wearing the little guy on your hands instead of hugging him. Perhaps, if you get these mittens, you should give each of them a pet name. Is this why one can find teddy bears made out of rabbit and deerskin and other such things? I think I am onto something here, something in the male psyche? Wouldn't you agree? We have noticed size L is outselling size M 3 to 1. We're onto something there, too, aren't we?
