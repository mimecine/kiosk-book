One item we knew about before we got to Greece was the oinometra cup. When we landed, we quickly sought out the maker and visited him at what I thought was going to be a factory, but which turned out to be a basement workshop in a residential building, in the middle of a conservative suburb. When we arrived, I was so convinced we were in the wrong place, I cursed Google maps. The towel was thrown, and I was already planning our next destination. However, my hunch was way off the mark. Who knew that one crazy man, his brother, and \- sometimes \- his son could produce the majority of the aluminum goods on the market in Athens, all from their subterranean workshop, while serving us ouzo and homemade capers, too? This delivery tray may make you think of the Indian chaiwallas, and you would be right: the premises of the Indian and the Greek trays are the same: centrifugal force keeps everything in place. Centrifugal force is...well, I can’t explain it to you, I was never great in science. I just know you can swing this thing around like mad, and the bottles won’t tip over, which makes it a perfect carrying tray. Come to think of it, there is a similar one in Germany too, for delivering kölsch glasses. Some forces are universal.
