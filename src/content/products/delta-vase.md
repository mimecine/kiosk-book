Designed in 1981 by Mart van Schijndel, a Dutch design icon, the vase was made in three sizes: small, medium and large. However, the small is all that remains from the original production. Consisting of three sheets of glass held together with three perfect silicone joints, it doesn't get more minimal than this. Made by hand - this is not art pottery, but a glass extravaganza. The Delta vase is included in the permanent collection of the MoMA in New York and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.
