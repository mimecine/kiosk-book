This dish brush is based on a traditional object from Sweden. Its 100% natural fibers are made of broom root, a grass which grows in the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is produced by the Iris Group, a foundation founded in the late 1800s which employs the visually impaired. Please let dry standing up!
