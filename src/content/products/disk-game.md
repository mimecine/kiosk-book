Kurt Naef created the disk game in the 1970s as a way to teach young children coordination skills and size differences. A fourth generation family firm, Juho Jussila produces Jukka toys. In 1923 they got their start by manufacturing everyday wooden items such as ladders and electrical plates. In 1926 they made their first game, Fortuna, and have been producing top-notch toys ever since. Since the Finns claim Santa lives in Finland, I would venture to say Jukka is as close to Santa's workshop as I'll ever get. While visiting, we were not allowed into one part of the factory; perhaps this is where you find all the elves.
