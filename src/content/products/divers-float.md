Is it a giant orange? A punching bag? There was a lot of talk at the bike shop when we stopped in to inflate our floats. Divers tie the line off to a rope attached to their boat and hold onto the line before they dive and also as a marker when they are diving. You can't miss the bright orange from under the sea. That's a pretty picture. If you are not a diver, I am not sure exactly what you can do with it besides admire and like it and think about going diving. Why not?
