Submarines have always been close to my heart. I have never suffered from claustrophobia, and when I was a kid the world under the surface was as alluring as outer space. I dreamed up underwater bases. I even made somewhat physically accurate section drawings of how these bases would work, complete with pressurized wet room entrances, mini-sub docks and, of course, a periscope. I even had a solution for air supply. I was a serious 7-year-old. I planned to build the thing in our local lake - but those plans died when I realized my chosen spot was only two feet deep and really muddy. Later in life, I ended up doing the Swedish military service. My task was to search for Russian submarines, mini and conventional. That was for real, but amounted to horsing around in a cabin in the Swedish archipelago. Not bad as service. Gladly, with this plastic sub I can experience the excitement of finding an actual submarine. (Or, maybe I did, but that would be s3cr1t!) The deep-sea base has to wait... Add baking powder and see it go. Comes with instructions, no assembly or master plans required.
