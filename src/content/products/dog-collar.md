We stayed at Maria's small inn and Lola the dog was always there to meet us at the beginning and end of every day. She took some time to warm up to Marco but soon she was taking over my role! On our last night I came into our room to find Lola on MY (her) pillow on MY (her) bed sleeping so cozily, tucked in under MY (her) blanket! Lola! What could I do besides sleep in a chair and leave her be. Luckily, she soon got homesick for her mom and she took off to her OWN bed. We presented her with a new collar when we were leaving. Very simple and pretty; please note the red detail on the edge. Being that it is leather, it ages well, many dog years.
