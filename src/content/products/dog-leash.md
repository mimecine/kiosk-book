Just how many Doggie-Delight stores are out there? Pampered Pooch? Right now we don't have a poochy to pampery but if I did I would for certain buy this cardinal-red lead. For years I have been trying to talk Marco into ADOPTING (not BUYING, please, everybody) a half-crazy terrier when we are in France. You know those nutty, medium-sized dogs with long, wiry hair who roam the streets in search of some merguez or camembert? We once met the sweetest guy doggie named Poupuce on a farm in France. Perhaps if I hang the leash by the door with our dog collar attached to it, Marco will finally break down this Christmas or the next and find me a little buddy!
