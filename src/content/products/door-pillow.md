An object which the Dutch themselves do not recognize. Spotted at our favorite broetje place in Amsterdam, our favorite coffee shop in the same, and the Cathedral of Gouda. What these three places have in common, I have no idea. Essentially the pillow acts as a doorstop, the advantage being that it can not be trodden on and it allows for the door to be easily opened and closed. Its workings are simple: one nail goes on the inside of a door and another goes on the outside. Hook each end of the pillow onto a nail. When both ends are hooked, your door is propped open ever so slightly by the pillow and people can come and go as they please with no hesitations. Hooked onto one nail, the pillow hangs against the door and out of the way. When we inquired, people thought of it as nothing special and implied that everyone has one, and people who didn't have one had never seen the object before. Perhaps it was born from a secret society? A Mason pillow? The leather ages nicely with time.
