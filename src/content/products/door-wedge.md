Prop open the door and let the fresh air stream into the house, the apartment, the dog-ridden den or the kid’s playroom. Air it all out. Let nature sweep over you and purify your home like no electrical device can. In nature you can breathe deep… keep the door open and bring it inside. Lee said this reminded him of home. Peter said it’s funny to choose a doorstop from England as in the UK this is the one thing the fire marshal is always on the prowl for. It has a nice little hole to put a cord through for easy hanging. Everything has its place in some of our worlds, in some of our hearts.
