The Douk-Douk was first made in 1929 by M. C. Cognet in Thiers and continues to be produced the same way today. Consisting of simple parts with a depiction of the Douk-Douk, the Melanesian spirit-god of doom and destruction, the knife is similar to the Japanese Higonokami knife. Small enough to fit in your pocket, it has a stopping mechanism which prevents it from closing too fast. If I knew much about knives I would be able to give you all the knife jazz but I don't. Overall, I am not intimidated by this knife; I find it accessible and I like the ring on the end for clipping and hanging. Generally, my Douk-Douk lives on a nail in the studio. Very often it comes in handy. Now made in a variety of colors, etc this model is the original.
