If you want to see a young child get really excited with walking, please give them this toy or something similar. Unlike other walking toys that make less-than-pleasant sounds, all you hear from the dove-on-a-stick is a flap-flap of its wooden wings. It works well on smooth or rough surfaces, and really propels a child onward into the wilds of the world, living room, garden, etcetera. Handmade by a family-owned business - the same gang of two that produces our drums and tambourines.
