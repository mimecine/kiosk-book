This will reach 3.3700787 feet down your sink. Not all the way back to Portugal like the giant one the pros bring when your sink is running way too slow. It reaches right to where you have been storing that bunch of hair, fingernail clippings, earrings... Eww, what is that gunk that collects around the detritus in your drain? Never mind what it is, just get it all out with this snazzy thing that you think you don't need, until you do. And then nothing else will do. And this one fits under your sink.
