An object which covers the entrance to your drain pipe so you can go and watch the local game rather than clean the gutters. Fits snugly into an opening with a matching diameter. How did we find this and why? I can tell you I did not go to the Netherlands looking for one. Hardware store ramblings lead to the strangest finds - this is what we do. I know you know what I mean. What else would you use this for?
