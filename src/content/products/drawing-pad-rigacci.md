I walked into Rigacci not because I had heard of them but I should have. I entered the store not knowing what I was looking for and I was glad I did not know. I was captivated by the warmth, the sincerity, the generosity in the shopkeepers face. I rambled through the supplies, all the best things were present. I dreamed I was a painter so I could access the beautiful colors they produce and fantasized that once I got to know them better I could poetically suggest other colors to formulate. Yet, I am a simple artist, mainly working with the pen, occasionally the pencil or an odd charcoal. And so, I found, without assistance but only with gentle, wordless glances from the shopkeepers eyes, this notebook, filled with a paper made of wheat, valued for the light it catches and the beauty it brings to even the most simple sketch in charcoal. For now I am very pleased and for later, I dream to one day go back to Rigacci as a painter.
