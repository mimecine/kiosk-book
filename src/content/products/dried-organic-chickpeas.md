When we are in the South of France we tend to eat quite a good amount of salad, and in our salad I often add chickpeas. Maybe it is becasue they are high in protein, or that they are one of the earliest cultivated vegetables, with chickpea remains dating from 7,500 years ago. Or perhaps it is that they have been ground as a coffee substitute in the past? For whatever reason, they are popular in the South of France; because of this, when we are there, it feels natural to eat them. We are always searching for organic foods produced by small farms; these chickpeas are the beginnings of a new crop grown by our lavender people. It's so small, in fact, they were reluctant to sell me any. Do you say chickpea or garbanzo?
