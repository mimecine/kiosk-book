I had never heard of an egg pricker before I went to Germany, however, most Germans say it is impossible to boil eggs without one! An egg pricker pricks an egg with a sharp point that pops out when the egg is pressed onto the device. The sharp point makes a tiny hole in the egg that stops the egg from breaking when boiled. OK...I mentioned I have boiled eggs for 21 years without needing an egg pricker - why do I need one now? The reply was: "How can you boil an egg without one? You just can't!" OK...I guess if you need to boil the perfect egg to serve the perfect breakfast in the land of perfection, then you need this. I am not sure what it says about my personality, but once I tried the egg pricker I have never gone back...hmmmm...
