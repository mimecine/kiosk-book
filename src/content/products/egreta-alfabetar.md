A tool to teach kids how to spell - you'll find the Romanian alphabet in there, based on the Latin alphabet like English, but with 31 letters. A little spice in the dice. Possibly, not worth the heartburn if you are not Romanian or a linguistics nut. However, this object may be of interest to you besides the fact as the box is very attractive and comes in handy for other things. Please note, this is a non-digital device - it is not going to help you with pronunciation. Remember, Bucharest = Bucharesti. It's all in the ear, not in the eye. With the Romanian language and other such things in Romania, what you see is not what you get. It all takes some time to understand.
