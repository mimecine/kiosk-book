Good stuff you don't want to miss. A syrup known to cure the oncoming cold, flu, or other ailments. Wow, the statistics are pretty surprising. In studies, patients taking elderberry syrup cut down their sick days to two days vs six for those who got a placebo. Why? Elderberries are loaded with antioxidants. If you're still not buying it, you can always mix the syrup into pancakes like they do in Central Europe. The word on the street is that some places use the deliciousness in this little bottle to make cocktails. Yes, cocktails. So sneak a little into your vodka, mix it in with some gin, top off your glass of soda water, and get ready to get healthy. Isn't it nice to be healthy and have something delicious in your mouth? There are many elderberry syrup blends out there. This one is excellent as the elderberry is grown by the maker; it has no refined sugar nor is it sweetened with honey, which can overpower the taste of the elderberry. Can I ask you one question, though: those people who were sick for six days, who are they? I can't remember a time I called in sick or considered myself ill for six days. Is this all really just about a frame of mind, or is it the elderberry? I am afraid only the future knows.
