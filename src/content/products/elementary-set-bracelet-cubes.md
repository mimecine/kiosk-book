Simple, geometric, intellectual...it feels good when you wear it. Made by Jonathan Berger-artist, professor and lecturer extraordinaire. For Mini-Exhibition #4 Jonathan organized the lecture evening "Independent Production". To represent his Mini-Exhibition he chose to exhibit his bracelets at KIOSK. You might say they are just scrumptious.
