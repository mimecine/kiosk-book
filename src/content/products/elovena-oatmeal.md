Ahhaahha....Elovena, or as one Finnish friend wrote, E-Love-Na. She's beautiful, is she the Finnish ideal? With the way so many people have referred to her I have to say YES. Well, blonds are not my type, so I was not sold on the packaging, but luckily we eat a lot of oatmeal at home so I did a taste test. Swedish and Scottish oats: far larger but break down into a porridge consistency if overcooked; American oats: a bit too large (sound familiar? like other things in America?); Finnish oats: I found I really liked as they are a small oat that immediately forms into a porridge-like texture upon cooking. Since the oat is smaller, they would not be good for oatmeal cookies - the American oats are best for this. Here is my Finnish oatmeal recipe: 1 cup oats, 2 cups water, cook, when done put some rice milk, flax seed, one sliced banana, whole buckwheat (for crunch), cinnamon, nutmeg and maple syrup on top for decoration, as much as you like. Good for the mind, spirit and soul, just like E-Love-Na.
