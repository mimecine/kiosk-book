Kitty drinks out of this bowl and Rufus does too. Katie eats her cereal and Jimmy his brew. Johnny loves barley and Jorge likes clams. Sassy eats yogurt and Todd digs ham. We all get down with these bowls at the KIOSK and you should too. After all, my friend Chris found these bowls when he was in Colombia and brought all three colors all the way home for you.
