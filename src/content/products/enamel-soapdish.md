Basic. Good for the country or the city. Perfect next to the studio sink. My husband thinks of Provence. Yuki thinks of Portugal. Let's all do a bit of time travel with the soap dish. As for me, I think of my first, and also my second, apartment in New York, the type with the shower in the kitchen and one sink for the whole place. I would have loved to install this soap dish over the sink then. Times have changed - I have two sinks now, but I still have the shower in the kitchen, and I love having the soap dish over the kitchen sink today.
