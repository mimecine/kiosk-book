It's true, I agree, these are expensive.  
However, think for a moment...  
how many plastic containers  
have you tossed out  
because they are stained  
or because they always feel oily?  
And by the way, plastic is not good  
to store edibles in.  
The night's leftovers go into one  
all together  
and are brought to work the next day for lunch.  
Although this is not a "lunch box,"  
I use it this way,  
and every time I open it,  
I think of the fun we had  
the night before  
when I look at my leftovers.  
They stack, and with the little ridge  
on the top,  
they do not slide around.  
Also, as they are enamel, they can go  
from the refrigerator  
straight to the stove top or oven.  
Fewer dishes!
