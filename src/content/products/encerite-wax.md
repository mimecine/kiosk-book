The Portuguese have a way of polishing their wood floors, I noticed it right away: very beautiful, very unique. Deep and rich and undulating. You know it gets that way because it is applied by hand, as the pretty Portuguese maid shown on the lid does. Pretty poor thing... Everyone knows that mopping only pushes the dirt around. My mother never used a mop; using a rag and your hand was the proper way to clean a floor! I have to agree, sadly. You know Encerite has got to be good as it has been produced since 1927 and was awarded gold metals at the Great Industrial Exhibitions of 1932 and '33. I don't think the categories of "cleaning supplies" or "wood finishing products" were included in Expo '98, held in Lisbon, but if they were, Encerite would have won. Directions: Apply with a cloth, let dry for about an hour, then polish by hand with a dry cloth to a high sheen. The color is clear; Encerite comes in a range of tones, even lavender. Dying to try lavender on our floors.
