What is it with me? I don’t associate with any religion. (I’ve been agnostic since I was 15.) However, I do find religion and religious artifacts fascinating. There is a level of beauty within them unlike anything else. Be the religion Hindu, Catholic, Greek Orthodox, or what have you, I find myself drawn to temples, churches, convents, and cathedrals all over the world. My emotions vary from wary to wonder; I swing from shame, when I am put off by something, to confusion and embarrassment, when tears come to my eyes unbidden, and I don’t know why they are uncontrollable. I wonder what that is? I find it incredibly fascinating that people can be so devoted to something which is, in reality, another person’s creation. Is religion the ultimate creative experience? There are three different sets of Ex Votos: one, of body parts: have a right hand, look at me with your eyes, lend me your ear, and exhibit a torso; a second set, for all men and women, to hit all the bases; and a third, representing a house, a marriage, and giving thanks \- as a happy house and marriage are a rare thing, especially in New York.
