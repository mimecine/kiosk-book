A perky eyeglass case discovered in Tokyo.  
We were flying over the Bering Strait.  
It is bright white.  
My shades were in danger,  
as they were case-less.  
Luckily, the answer came to me in Tokyo,  
and my sunglasses returned home  
safely in it.  
It is not hinged together,  
but one piece fits inside the other -  
this is best for strength.  
Each is lined with the signature violet color.
