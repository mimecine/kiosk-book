Benamôr face cream, with the tag line "adorable beauty product that confers upon the skin a lovely tone of freshness," was registered in 1928 by a pharmacist. Used by everyone from Salazar, Portugal's last dictator, to Queen D. Amelia, Portugal's last queen. Silently scented. Attractive packaging. Located in many good pharmacies throughout Portugal. It became my moisturizer of choice when Marco's accident with my toiletries bag resulted in my regular face cream being left behind under the bed in Tomar. I was visually displeased he lost my regular solution, but secretly excited to have a reason to buy a tube of Benamôr. That was in July of 2009; I continue to use it since, kissing my "regular" bye-bye, goodbye.
