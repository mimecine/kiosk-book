The Famos vegetable peeler is so fabulous, with its simple profile and stunning nib for cutting out potato eyes. And such a great finish. Oh damn, what a glamorous vegetable peeler! In these days of "luxury" condos and stainless kitchen appliances, don't you deserve something this divine? Go ahead and treat yourself to a kitchen tool that's sharp as hell and way cooler than the bulbous crap on the market that takes up too much space in the drawer. Note! When using this phoenix, you peel towards yourself, contrary to safety rules. I am certain you can handle it.
