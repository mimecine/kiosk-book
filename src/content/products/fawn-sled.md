The thing about a sled that makes it different from all other forms of snow travel, the thing that makes it magic, is the fact that you can't really steer. You give in to forces much larger than yourself the moment you sit your butt in the seat. The first force is perhaps your father, pulling you through the powder and up the hill. How is he so strong and sure but reckless and free? How can he just abandon you to the even greater force of gravity? Gravity is even stronger and more certain. Gravity goes only one way for us tiny humans: down. So down the giant hill, screaming you go. Down, down, down. All the way to the gentle slope where you come panting to a halt. Jump out of the sled and yell "Again! Again!" Your cheeks are flushed with the cold air and your first taste of adrenaline. "Again! Again!" A wooden sled made by the last wood toboggan manufacturer in the United States.
