Marco swore we needed a feather duster  
at KIOSK  
to become more efficient dusters.  
I swore we would never have the tutti-frutti one from Chinatown  
at our place of business nor our home  
(and really I did not understand the necessity of dusting more efficiently).  
Since he found this handmade brown one in Japan  
made by a firm established in 1830,  
our world of dusting suddenly became complete.  
I got a little concerned  
when one of our employees saw it  
and said  
they were going to use it to  
tickle all the customers.
