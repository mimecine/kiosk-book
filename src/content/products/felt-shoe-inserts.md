When walking in nature it is important to keep two things warm \- the feet and the head. Cold passes through the feet and up the body creating chill. Stop the chill with felt shoe inserts and walk carefully in nature. In order to enjoy the outdoors, I need to be warm. When I discovered felt shoe inserts, I found I never felt nature like this before. Made by hand in Sweden, my original pair has lasted me 7 years thus far. Once a year, I soak them in cool, soapy water, press the water through, squeeze them out and hang them dry, preferably in the sun. Refreshed!
