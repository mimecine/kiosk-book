Mark till your heart's content, stays on porcelain, mirror, metal, etc. Comes in handy when you least expect it. For instance, if you need to label your bicycle or write your husband a daily reminder message on the bathroom mirror, "Put your laundry in the basket" or on the refrigerator door (as long as it is not white) "Please close the door and do your dishes", etc, etc. Made by a firm established in 1907, we visited their factory in the countryside. It was a small place adjacent to the owner's home. The mother of the home and co-owner of the business showed us around. The top floor was packing and warehousing; the bottom floor was where the goods were made. It was a pretty exciting operation. Totally down to earth and very basic, not at all what one imagines when you have their product in your hand. I was thinking assembly line, teams of people, industrial environment, etc, etc.
