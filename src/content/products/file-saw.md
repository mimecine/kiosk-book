2003, 2004, 2005 - you have to ask me, why I am counting? -  
but don't stop me for too long -  
I'm so in love with this tool -  
I am making perfect holes around town with this  
on every surface I can get my hands on.  
Up at the Frick they got a little upset,  
Storefront for Art and Architecture thought I was "authorized,"  
Puppy Playland was SO busy they did not even notice.  
If you are into peepholes, we have got one tool for you!  
A file saw that makes a perfect circle!
