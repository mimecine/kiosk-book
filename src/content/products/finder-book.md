Take a stroll with these guides, and we guarantee you'll be able to label and identify anything that comes along the forest path. Why wander only for fresh air and peaceful beauty? Go armed with books in hand and know your stuff. But wait \- there is more. Are you into systematics like me? These guides are not only a good read, they are a great afternoon ramble from your armchair. Plant identification, like bird watching, is one of the most relaxing things one can do. One book for flowers, the other for trees. You should get both if you want to act like a know-it-all in nature, as I do.
