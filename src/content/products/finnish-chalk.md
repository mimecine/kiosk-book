Made by a firm established in 1907. We visited their factory in the countryside, located in a small area adjacent to the owner’s home. The mother of the home and co-owner of the business showed us around. The top floor was packing and warehousing, the bottom floor was where the goods were made. We saw the oven where the chalk is baked as well as the rooms where the watercolors were processed, one color at a time, with the room shifting color based on whichever was being produced. It was a pretty exciting operation. Totally down to earth and very basic, not at all what one imagines with one of their products in the hand. I was thinking assembly lines, teams of people, industrial environment, etc etc. It is very different from the New Jersey Turnpike industrial view. Each chalk has a paper sleeve.
