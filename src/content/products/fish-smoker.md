Add the fish and chips (no pun intended), seal and place it on a campfire or in a grill; the heat of the fire causes the wood chips to smoke rather than ignite, creating a portable, mini-smokehouse. Depending on the size of the fish and temperature of the fire, in 30 minutes to 2 hours you will have a delicious smoked fish. We visited the factory that makes the smoker. The foreman told us despite what people say, he puts salt on the fish AFTER it has been smoked but many people do salt the fish before smoking. Smoked fish is delicious and once one gets the hang of it, a low-maintenance experience. Smoked fish, horseradish and some potatoes for me! I think I deserve it after writing all this text.
