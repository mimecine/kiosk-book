How could we not have a fishing basket from Portugal when, after all, fish is in the bloodstream there! Who cares if you don't fish or eat fish... this basket can be used for many things. It has a place to put a strap. At our house we hang it from a hook and use it to hold potatoes. Why not! Onion basket from the Shakers, fishing/potato basket from the Portuguese! What next? Oh boy, we really are nutty! It closes with a tiny whittled stick. Just big enough for the average fisherman/potato lover.
