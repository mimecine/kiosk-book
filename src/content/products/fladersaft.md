Citric and sweet at the same time, this is just the most perfect summer beverage. Made by boiling the elderberry flowers for a night with loads of sugar (no, worries, when the saft is diluted to the proper strength it's most likely the equivalent of two Diet Cokes in sugar content). Good in bubbly too. The elderberry tree has been called “the medicine chest of the common people.” The flowers, leaves, berries, bark and roots have all been used in traditional folk medicine for centuries. The berries contain more vitamin C than any other herb except rosehip and black currant. The elder tree also has a rich background of cultural superstitions. In the Middle Ages, legend held that the tree was home to witches and that cutting one down would bring on the wrath of those residing in the branches. The Russians and the English believed that elder trees ward off evil spirits and it was considered good luck to plant one near your home. Sicilians think that sticks of elder wood can kill serpents and drive away thieves. Regardless, take some of the saft in a glass and have it as sweet or light as you like; it is very refreshing! Made by a small fruit producer in the countryside.
