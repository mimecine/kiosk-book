Minty fresh - AHHH. Dragon breath can be a real issue. Fight the dragon with Angel Mints and let your halitosis fly away. Goodbye, dragon; hello, angel. First produced in 1919 in Wildwood, New Jersey, the Angel Mint, like several other Northern products, flew south when the owners wanted to retire to that heavenly place called "FLORIDA." The candy continues to be made on machines from 1915 and the ingredients remain just as simple. The story goes the name came about as so many people were telling the inventor his mints were "heavenly," hence "angel" came into play. With a chalky flavor and a very pure taste - come here and give me a kiss.
