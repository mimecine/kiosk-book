Florida bits and hot pots at Sundhöllin pool hall in Reykjavik under the stars. I loved sitting there simmering away with my box of bites protected in their waterproof pouch. It only gets tricky when the kids start hovering and I begin to feel like I am having a “Let the Right One In” moment. Florida seems to be an exotic place to Icelanders. I can understand why. No coconuts in Iceland.
