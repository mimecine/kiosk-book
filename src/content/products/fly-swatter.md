This product was the result of a request. A girlfriend of mine has a house upstate and in the summer has flies, as all country houses do. She asked if we had something tasteful to swat with. We did not, how shameful! Perhaps because I don't kill insects; I follow the trap-and-release policy except in dire straits. The only exception is mosquitoes, which can be killed freely and without any remorse. We have such a mosquito problem in the West Village that we sleep with a mosquito net in the warm months (two-thirds of the year at this stage), and I have been known to wake up in the night, throwing on the light in a karate pose, ready to pounce. I go after the biters with a vengeance! Next warm season I'll have this swatter and Ditch that Itch next to my bed, waiting. In the one hand, preventative medicine, in the other, restorative.
