Do you remember another flying turtle called "Gamera"? When I was a kid, every chance I got I was glued to the TV watching Godzilla - the early Japanese ones, Kaiju. Gamera was my favorite character. I assume so because I had a pet turtle who lived at my grandmother's that I loved; I loved him, but I really loved his pebbles and his bowl - the design was fantastic. So how about this Flying Turtle? It came into our lives when we got lost in "Celebration" - no, that's not a musical featuring the Gap Band, but a town near Walt Disney World - a corporate adventure in housing built by Disney in the 80s. It will shock you with its oldie-goodie feel and architectural styles for everyone. We were in Celebration and we got lost - I mean not just slightly lost, but really lost - and I started freaking out because everything looked the same (well, in batches of the same), and all these porches had cute little lights on them and every lawn was perfect and there were no people and we were trapped...for 20 minutes and Google Maps was of no help. Lost in the sauce and driving around, the only normal thing we found, in my eyes, was the Flying Turtle. A beacon of light in the generic and geriatric Celebration! In a driveway...on stand-by. You use the turtle by swinging the handlebars back and forth. Fine for people 150 lbs and under. First produced in 1982.
