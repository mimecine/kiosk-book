Who doesn't need folders for the taxes, news clippings, and love letters? Recipes, notes and drawings, grandiose ideas? Sometimes I get slightly threatful letters asking me to pay a bill, every so often, but I file them away in these little colorful plastic sheets and hide them between books until they are forgotten. Doesn't work so well, but at least they look pretty. The folders come as a set of red, blue and yellow to start getting you in the mood.
