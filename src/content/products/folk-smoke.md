A natural smoke, an easy smoke, a smoke that is not necessarily easier on your lungs than the bad smoke, but in theory is better for you. A smoke for pure enjoyment out in the woods with a dream. I don't necessarily encourage you to smoke, but I have been told this smoke helps you quit the bad smoke, so I have to encourage you to smoke this one but not for long. Good for practicing the hand-rolling skills. Found at the Hunger Mountain Coop in Montpelier, an excellent resource for Vermont-made products, and all food for that matter. I bought a milk there that blew my mind, until I realized it was cream. Still delicious, but I was like, Wow, these Vermont cows, they know how to make it. Chris's friend's sister's boyfriend used to date the maker - FYI - just a coincidence.
