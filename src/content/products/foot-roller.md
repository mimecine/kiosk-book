A foot massager composed of 90 rotating elements, mounted on six axles, 45 of which are smoothly rotating, 45 are curved and rotating, sounds delicious! A definitively geriatric product unknowingly desired by all ages. A German friend described this item as old-faithful, what you give if you have run out of ideas to give. I send that with what to give to the person who has everything they need and/or the person with foot problems, back pain, stress issues, headaches...that's basically everyone out there. Cross your grandmother, aunt, son, husband off the gift list as solution found! Come to think of it maybe you need one for after the holidays too. 30 year guarantee
