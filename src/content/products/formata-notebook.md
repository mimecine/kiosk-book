A breakdown of the cover: "Lined Notebook German" and the always-appearing STAR. Again, why is the star on so many Mexican graphics? By the time Mexico is finished at KIOSK (hopefully never, as I love it so) I swear I will have discovered what the star is all about. If anyone has any tips, please let me know. Another mystery is present in this notebook: why German? The lines are lovely but being that I am a notebook collector of sorts, I see no connection between the lines in this book and any German notebook I have come across. It's interesting how products develop. Imagine, one day a designer working for Formata was given the task of producing a new notebook for children to practice their penmanship in; at the end of the day he had designed the "Formata Star Writing Notebook," he presented it to his boss... What the h\*ll is "Star Writing," we need something more exotic than this if we want to sell! What country is the furthest from us in sensibility? Looking to the east on the map and then north they found Germany. I'd say Germany is pretty different from Mexico and therefore exotic, wouldn't you? But perhaps this notebook could also be called "Lined Notebook Morocco" and it would make just as much sense. But then again, maybe this notebook is designed around a traditional German notebook. Until Kiosk covers Germany this mystery may just have to rest. SIDENOTE: We did cover Germany and still the mystery is not solved! Damn!
