Actually, a German person did not introduce me to the wedges, a Swede who had lived in Germany did. You see, this is a product all insiders know but that takes an outsider to point out. A brilliant tool for around the home based on a simple premise - everyone has a piece of furniture that needs to be leveled off! These wedges simply fill the gap and then snap off. No messy wood shims or matchbooks - say goodbye to an uneven life. Das furniture wedgy is here to stay!
