People in the kitchen, please take note! A piled-on pyramid of measuring mania. A simple object that replaces all of those standard Pyrex cups. I know your grandmother had one, but have you ever really enjoyed using it? Cook with ease and more pleasure! And while you are bathing in a light of endless happiness and baking, Lend a Hand to your local school, your library, your community center, or your Humane Society with a bake sale. Shake it all up. Most importantly, Lend a Hand to your fellow man in need of food. Young or old, near or far, Lend a Hand; food can change any mood.
