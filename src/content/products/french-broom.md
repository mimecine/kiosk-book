If it is good enough for every French household, you'll find it suits your needs, too. Après tout, les Français ont plus d'amusement de nettoyage, non? Et le français est la langue de l'amour. Lend a Hand to your love life, use this broom. Do Note! For environmental reasons, we do not ship or sell the broom pole. That you will need to pick up at your local hardware and screw the broom head on. You know what the French say...
