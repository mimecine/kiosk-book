Chalky and chewy to varying degrees. It starts a bit dry and buttery but over time turns soft and smooth. Never crunchy or hard, these are not the type of caramels that will bust a crown. Rich in taste. You’d want to eat them while playing cards with the foxes in your own moss garden. Grandmotherly candies: sincere, straightforward and sweet.
