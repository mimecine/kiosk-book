Forget the paper towel trick for drying fried foods, let them rest on the metal mesh and drip dry. Makes for a crispier fry, a sharper eggplant, and a crunchier tempura. If you are going to fry something, do it right so you really enjoy it. "Bounty" paper towels certainly do not add to the flavor of your deep-fried tofu!
