No plastic for me, please - in the kitchen it tends to melt. Metal is preferred in our home. Funnels are especially necessary if you buy in bulk, which we do. The skinny tip is ideal for liquids of all kinds. The larger funnel is technically for filling sausages but I use it to pour all sorts of grains and beans into storage jars. It's always been a drag filling up the containers with a rolled piece of paper. Liquid and dry goods are the story. I know it is hard to judge the openings in the picture; please take our word for it.
