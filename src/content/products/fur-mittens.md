We asked for navy blue fabric but we got black, we asked for brown wool but we got white fur. In Romania, things often do not go as planned - live and learn, something, of some sort. Regardless, they are very warm and super cosy. We found them at an agricultural market held once a month in Sighet, in the far north of the country. I was searching for one of the giant shearling coats I heard come from the region. Instead, I wound up walking away with a very 70s-inspired shearling vest. Good salesmanship, she had - lessons to be learned. This woman had amazing things, much of which, as I discovered, if worn outside of the region, look over-the-top peculiar. Not these gloves however.
