_Ahhhhh_, say _ahhhh__._ Breathe deep...can you? Every mother knows gargling with salt is the best cure for a sore throat. What salt could be better then pure alpine salt from the center of the earth? Instructions: gargle twice a day, morning and night if you have a sore throat, gargle twice a week if you live in an urban environment, gargle before performances, use in the nose (if you can stand it) as needed, put a teaspoon in a bowl of quite hot water for a purifying nasal steam.
