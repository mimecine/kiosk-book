We all know the cubes that expand into a towel  
and the t-shirts from Muji, too.  
Do you remember the sponges shaped like dinosaurs?  
This gauze cloth won't expand as much,  
but conceptually  
it is a distant relative.  
8 layers of compacted mosquito net:  
absorbent and dries fast!  
Before use, rinse the starch off  
in hot water.  
YES, it does get soft.  
Those geometric patterns make me think of water molecules.  
I use it all summer as a cooling cloth!
