Pretty packaging. What the hell... Gelatina is gelatin, as you might have guessed. Melt the strips with warm water and cook up all the puddings and Jell-O desserts you desire. Or do as I did, and buy the package for the graphic design. When we were planning our gingerbread Kiosk (house) for Christmas this year, Beth mentioned the Gelatina is perfect for glass in the windows. Not bad, not bad at all. It even has a patterned surface.
