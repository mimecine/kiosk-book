_Tweet__!_ Perfect size for the fire escape (a.k.a. THE balcony - yeah right, we all have a terrace don't we?). Just in time for spring house-making. It makes me think of a German fairytale with its curvaceous roof. Please don't ask what type of bird suits this - I have no idea, if anyone does, just let me know and I will add it on here.
