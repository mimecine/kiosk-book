I believe it is not at all what Mr. Gandhi smelled like, but maybe how he liked to smell or what he liked to smell. Put a smell on it! Smellbound... Perhaps not the most delicious smell but really, just buy it for the packaging, I did. Anyway, just because I am not wild about the smell does not mean you won’t go nuts over it, you are your own person you know!
