A girl-head candle in the style of an 18th-century aristocratic daughter, ringlets and all. I find it interesting that there is no suggestion of a blouse, only a bare neck that ends on a pedestal. Made by one of the prettiest shops in Lisbon, the candle store Caza das Vellas Loreto, established in 1726, which sits in the heart of Barrio Alto. We worked with them for a long time to get the color just so. With her droopy eyes and puffy cheeks you know the girl has a heart of stone, beautiful, cunning, self-serving. Let's burn her up. Just wait until you get to the middle. Wow.
