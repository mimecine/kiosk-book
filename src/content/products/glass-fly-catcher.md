The beauty of glass; a death catch for flies, it is but after all a Christmas ball with feet, produced by the same factory that creates holiday baubles which have delighted us for years. Clear and reflective, filled with honey water and apple cider vinegar, it does the quick trick to silence. My peace and quiet will be no longer disturbed by buzz buzz but rather the fading hum of a soft drowning noise of fuzz fuzz, guzz guzz. Good night sweet fly, I hope you have a good rebirth. Sure this is a little gruesome but what isn't in the land of pest death? At least it twinkles and flies do have very short lives. Note the loop at the top so that the catcher may stand or be hung from any old thing.
