"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose." is one of Gertrude Stein's most famous quotes. The line was from the poem "Sacred Emily." Stein references the rose over and over again in her writings. Ernest Hemingway appropriated the text when he wrote, "A bitch is a bitch is a bitch is a bitch." Roses have terrible and beautiful associations, don't they? It must be the combination of the scent, the color, the layering of the petals, and the sharp thorns. This glass rose is scentless but has all of the beauty one finds in a real rose, down to the sharp, little thorns. It makes a perfect gift.
