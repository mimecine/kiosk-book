For Cinderella...This type of glass work is often made in Puebla and Mexico City. Most often I have seen it associated with the trappings of weddings: Cinderella carriages, doves, hearts, wedding bells, and cake top decorations that combine all of the above, but I have also seen planes, pianos, cars, and a variety of animals. Very pretty, not to be worn on tippy toes, only for decoration, sorry.
