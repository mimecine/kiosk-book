An environmentally\-friendly glue for household and office use. Glue paper, pens, glue your mouth shut or your co-worker's mouth, for that matter. Give me some of that glue! The glass jar is refillable and the glue will keep for up to two years. It has a handy rubber applicator: not for fine details, but does provide an even application. Made of gum arabic \- the pure resin from the rubber tree that is edible and found in chewing gum, marshmallows, gummy candies (such as gummy bears!) and water.
