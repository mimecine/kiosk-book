Visiting Hong Kong there were three teas I was searching for: Golden Oolong, Pouchong and Pu-erh. Oolong is defined as being somewhere between black and green tea in oxidization. I love the smell of dry Golden Oolong tea, very fresh. Our tea is from Lam Kie Yuen Tea Co., established in 1955. Our visit was a lovely sit down experience. The Chinese have a very specific way of brewing tea which is formal but quite naturalistic and easy to catch onto. The tricky part is getting the timing right and remembering not to drink the first brew, it is for washing and hence warming the cups! For Golden Oolong, brew the tea with water at 200 to 215 degrees Fahrenheit, just around boiling. For the first infusion, wait 45 seconds; for the second, 50 seconds; the third, 60 seconds, etcetera. In total, the tea can be brewed 5 or 6 times. Golden Oolong is often served at dimsum; dimsum being so popular in Hong Kong, I thought it was nice to feature it in the collection.
