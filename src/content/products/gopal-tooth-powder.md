Teethering on the brink of divinity! Slightly sweet with a hint of mint. Not a mint explosion, but a touch of minty, tree bark goodness. Tastes like "space toothpaste" and closer to Tom's than Crest. Slightly sandy, it quickly dissolves into nothingness, dissolving like sugar and cinnamon, but it does not taste like cinnamon. It has more of an earthy flavor which could be the cloves or the kadukkai, a nut known to cure nagging coughs. Please note we are not selling this to ingest, only for the packaging! You decide if you use it or not.
