Baking soda has soooo many uses - too many, according to some - teeth whitener, odor eater, cleaning agent, baking ingredient, some sort of water bomb-maker (no, I won't say how). Chemicals are not always bad - this is a natural element after all! You can buy Arm & Hammer, but the Grand Crest brand has such nice graphics from the 70s. In a house where everything is considered to a tee, shouldn't your baking soda be considered too?
