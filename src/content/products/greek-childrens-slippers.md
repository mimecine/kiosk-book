It's inevitable that you will fall in love with these slippers. Just like when you take candy from a freebie dish on a counter, you won't be able to control yourself. Made to resemble a shoe called a tsarouhi, which used to be common all over Greece, but is now primarily worn by the Greek parliamentary guards and others in traditional costume. The pompom was a late edition. Designed to act as a water repellent, it can come in handy with small children. Fuzzy and cosy on the inside. The small size suits up to 2 years; medium, up to 4 years; and large for kids up to 6 years.
