Sometimes life can get a little scary, even overwhelming. I think that is the nature of the beast. It's nothing to be worried about. In fact, I would be worried if I never felt like a wave was coming over me and I was sinking slowly. Because, like when we swim in the sea, we slowly get pulled down, and then we slowly get lifted up. The problems come when we resist and start to fight the flow, the ebb and the tide. The flood, we all handle in different ways. The softest way I find is a radio, a nightlight, a drink, and a warm bed. I gather them around me and I float.
