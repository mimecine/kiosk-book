Before we went down to Greece, I got briefed by Danielle on the ins and outs. One thing she mentioned was the Greeks put oregano on everything \- she claimed everything \- except cucumber. That's ok with me. When I got back I thought: I have to tell her that I had some Greek salads in my travels, which had both cucumber and oregano. Was I lured into tourist traps on those occasions? I know that I was definitely taken for a ride at the Saturday market at Aeropoli, in the Mani, when I bought some oregano for my sandwiches. Sure, based on the appearance (of both the people and the herb) it must have been gathered in the wild, but they really got a kick out of ripping me off. I played along and let them go for it. Keep the two euro extra, I thought, as I smiled to the cheese man too, who also hosed me down. Only the caper-monger was a gentleman, dignified, even though he insisted on hugging and kissing me after my purchase...For good luck? I have to add that all of the sellers above were gentlemen, and the ladies were quite honest. I had a great time shopping, and now I have a new appreciation for Greek oregano. It's less bitter than the Italian.
