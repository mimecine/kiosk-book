As the ladies will tell you, there can never be a shortage of salve. Aged hands are the biggest giveaway. Holding hands is really a gateway opportunity. Kissing is great, but you are already deep in it by the time you are locking lips with your sweetie. Hugging is fine, but you hug your pappy, your aunt, and that one old guy who always comes to the barbecue. Holding hands is where it's at. If you're good, who knows where things will lead. It can be subtle and sublime. Magic is found between two soft hands swinging in the breeze as you walk through the covered bridge across town. But wait, your hands aren't soft at all! They're all crackly and dry, dusty and tired. Perk them up with some sweet, sweet salve before you grasp your lover's hand. Too bad you can't hold hands while your supple paws open a bottle of Pinot Noir on that blanket by the river across the bridge. But don't worry, you're in there. This romance is going to be great.Â be great.
