A notebook that is a hoot. Jason brought me one when he was in Amsterdam for Queen's Day in 2009 and I kept it on my desk for three years until we made the Dutch collection. We purchased what stock was left from our favorite office supply store in the Netherlands. Sadly, this is it. I don't understand why they finished the production - it's our most popular notebook to date! 1 cm grid paper. Good grey, red and white color combination.
