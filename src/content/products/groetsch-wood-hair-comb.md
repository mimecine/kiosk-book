The Groetsch family has been creating their combs since 1848. It is a father, mother and daughter operation. Pretty incredible, as they are fairly well represented in Germany. The father's father was the last master comb-maker in Germany. Today all of their work is still done in the traditional method - by hand. There is no finish on the wood because the teeth are so well polished, no fiber remains exposed on the comb. It is great to use on wet or dry hair. Their machinery is 150 years old. They have been generating the power they need by water turbine since 1900 - excess power is sold back to the state. It's all very idyllic and every time I use the comb I think of myself in New York and them, working away in their workshop in Germany. I believe objects either harbor their own being and give off an energy or we instill a certain energy into things. These combs provide a daily dose of tranquility, they radiate happiness and satisfaction.
