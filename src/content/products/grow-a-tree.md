Now, let me ask you something, why would you not want to plant a tree? I mean, sure, Bloomberg went a little nuts with his million tree plan - I'd love to ask how all those trees are going to be taken care of - but the point is, trees are good for us. Certain people in Congress might use the term "Tree Hugger" in a derogatory sense, but I have to say I like the visual. The point is, planting a tree is good for all of us. And the best thing is, if this thing makes it through one year, you have a good chance of having a tree that is going to outlive you. I like that.Â Apple to eat, giant redwood to admire, sugar maple to enjoy the fruits of and white birch to listen to the breeze.
