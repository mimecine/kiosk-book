You may know of quince paste? Sometimes you find it on fancier cheese plates around the world. Bocadillo is the South American equivalent and it is delicious too. When I go to Colombia, I am going to learn how to make it. The paste is most often made into small blocks and wrapped in a leaf from the bijao plant. The bijao is a very common tropical plant and the leaf is often used for food items - most commonly with tamales, as the fresh leaf has a natural wax coating on one side. Colombia is one of the largest guava producers in the world. When my friend Chris was in Colombia, he ate quite a bit of guava as it is very high in vitamin C - four times found in an orange. I have never been to Colombia, but he tells me it is common to get a piece of guava paste with your restaurant check. As he said, forget that after-dinner mint - who needs it? This is true.
