Naturally, I was drawn to the packaging, and why not? It's got interesting text in a foreign language and a great color combination; the paper has a nice look and touch. How can you lose? Sure, it could have been a shower cap, or a mosquito coil, but I was in a candy shop at the time so I assumed it was edible, to say the least. But wait, what's this? I peeked into the paper and saw a giant communion wafer filled with what looked like... nougat? An interesting combination, indeed. I tasted it, and what my eyes saw was confirmed at first bite. This was not just the body of Christ, but a sweet delight! "Epiphany!" I thought to myself. And indeed, the word comes from ancient Greek: a manifestation or a striking appearance. In this case I would say "Eureka!" (translation: "I have found it!") - see Archimedes. [
