The artist and teacher Kesuke Serizawa first designed this hand stenciled calendar in 1945. It has been in production ever since. In 1956, he was named a "Living National Treasure of Japan." He developed his technique of stencil making in Okinawa, printing on handmade washi paper in small quantities. The design is known throughout the country. The calendar is very delicate and considered to be a work of fine art.
