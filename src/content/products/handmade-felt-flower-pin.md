By Barbro Grytnäs, from Dalarna - an area north of Stockholm known for its strong traditional values. We were searching for traditional goods but were really taken by these beautiful pins. We swore once we were back to a phone in Stockholm we would track the designer down. She had us over for tea and then what followed were many hours of conversation about the development of Swedish design over the past 40-some years. Fascinating! Soon we were shown a few of her flowers and then several more. Ms. Grytnäs’ body of work was incredibly inspiring. Although she was hesitant to give us certain colors (in consideration of our store and what she believed New York people would prefer), we made out with some lovely blossoms. Each are handmade from felt scraps which ironically came from her former student Pia Wallén who designed the mittens we also sell. Ms. Grytnäs is a teacher, mentor and design icon in Sweden and she reminded us of the main reason why we are doing this work: to meet amazing, inspiring people such as she. We have not taken the flower off since.
