Andy from Reference Library included a Handy Handle in his mini-exhibition at KIOSK. He was not sure from where or how he acquired it. It took us some time to track down the manufacturer, but I am glad we did! I find it pretty mesmerizing. It just makes sense. Before the HH, my hands ached on Saturdays after going to the farmers' market and our local shops. Endowed with a British and American patent, the Handy Handle is a recent invention that feels largely overlooked. A handle to carry all your bags, a handle to wrap things together - plus the yellow is handy. The handle is friendly.
