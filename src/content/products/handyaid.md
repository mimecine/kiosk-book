A tool that Lends a Hand to your hand. It's a Handyaid! Beautiful thing! I'm tempted to call it a Frisbee Junior. Beautiful optical pattern described as "hundreds of suction cups." A Kiosk customer, who is a cook, tipped us off to it years ago. For some time we tried to track it down with no luck. Then we came across it at General Store in San Francisco. We called Handyaid and were told that after a several-year-long hiatus, the daughter of the inventor had brought this goodie back into production. It's an aesthetically pleasing help-tool. How many of those are out there? Orthopedics are never sexy. Win-Win.
