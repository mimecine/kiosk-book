Look up in Hong Kong! Wow, so much! With space being in short supply things are always hovering overhead, both inside and out. "The Hanging S" is the local solution for storing things on the up. Mostly made in neighborhood metalwork shops the "S" hooks over any pipe. The shape allows a lot of flexibility in terms of what one can hang on it. Now you are likely wondering how to put it up and take it down. That's where "The Hook" comes in, another common artifact from Hong Kong; it is the shopkeeper's trusty friend. In fact, I believe "The Hook" and "The Hanging S" might be the Hong Kong shopkeeper's icons.
