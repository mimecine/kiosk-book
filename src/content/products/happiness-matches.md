If you are a pyro these REALLY are happiness but if you are just into design and cool stuff then these are just happiness. Where do you fall? Be honest but please do not take action, I would hate it if some good boxes were destroyed only for pyromania. Nice paper quality to admire, interesting ink density, hand-assembled boxes, and very tiny wood matches, a fine example for the match collection indeed. There are 10 little guys inside each package.
