If I still smoked, I'd seriously smoke the real deal, although my guess is this is so strong it would probably stop anyone from actually smoking. But let's face it, it's really bad for you to smoke this, the best "lite" brands, or even "organic" smokies. Don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise. As we do not smoke, we haven't tried it ourselves â€” if I did that would mean I would lose my sense of scent and, paradoxically, I would miss my favorite fragrance: unburned tobacco. Anyway, if the day comes when I fall back, I know where to find the harshest stuff around.
