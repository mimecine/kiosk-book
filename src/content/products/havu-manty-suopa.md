Soft soap for cleaning is something seldom on the market, today’s cleaners are really just a big cook up of chemicals with softeners added to counter the hardeners added to counter the tensids to counter the detergents. The concoction is technically called, but not actually, soap. What we have here is just tall oil and lye cooked together. Okay, to be fair, both tall oil and lye are common chemicals and Havu Mänty has a mystery 20% of ingredients unaccounted for, but I still trust it more than most "natural" detergents. Cleans mats, cars, boats, brushes, rugs, etc. Good for your occasional hand-wash (sure, I have been running out of socks on trips...) and, according to a recipe from the 1890s, mixed with cooked snake it makes for a magic soap.
