Established in 1942, Ashidavox initially manufactured domestic speakers. In 1959, they invented the stereo headphone; ever since, they have been producing new and high quality sound systems. Their brand is known all over the world for progressive technology. What we offer is a retro-looking headphone with great sound. It can be used with any kind of electronic equipment that has a headphone jack. Ear buds leave much to be desired. Big, puffy pancakes on your ears make you look silly. Why compromise?
