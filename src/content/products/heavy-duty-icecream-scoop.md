Oh crap, another thing for the kitchen you really don't need. I could tell you this is the best, most functional ice cream scoop I have ever seen, anywhere in the world - would it matter? It is the last ice cream scoop you will ever buy - does it matter? Does it matter that when I rang up I spoke to one of the owners to place my order? Does it matter that they have been making these professional grade scoops for 50 years? Itâ€™s a classic and with all classics one is not enough, you need it.
