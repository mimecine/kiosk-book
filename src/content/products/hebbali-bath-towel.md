This towel dries you very effectively and dries up faster than you think, very lightweight cotton indeed. Made of "Khadi" or handspun cotton, Gandhiji's solution to India's problems. Every village should spin their own fabric. Every person should govern themselves. Every village should govern itself. Be self reliant. The country of India should govern itself. Swaraj. "The spinning wheel represents to me the hope of the masses…it brings about a silent and sure revolution." - Mahatma Gandhi.
