Hedgehogs are common in Europe, but they are not native to the United States, although they are one of the first mammals and have changed little over the past 15 million years. We had one in the garden when I lived in Stockholm, he/she would visit almost every evening at the height of summer. We lived in the center of the city so this was a surprise, but we also saw foxes and a long-eared hare would sometimes run down the adjacent street, leading me to think I was having a mystic moment. Until today when I was researching hedgehogs, I always thought our garden hedgehog was a porcupine - no wonder, as I am from the U.S.! This hedgehog is colored with natural pigment and has little brass wheels it rolls around on. It is a simple, natural toy. German toys are truly the best!
