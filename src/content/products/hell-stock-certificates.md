When I saw these I thought, "Oh, there must be so many people in New York who would love to send these to their broker nowadays." Whereas in the past one might send roses, send them this go-to-hell certificate telling them to fetch your fortune there. If you really want to freak them out, hand them one of these and burn the other four (there are five in a set) in front of them while you play "Disco Inferno." That will probably confirm you are nuts, although we cannot guarantee it will get your investment back, the rate of return will be pretty high.  
  
Satisfaction (uhu hu hu) came in the chain reaction  
(burnin') I couldn't get enough, (till I had to self-destroy) so I had to  
self destruct, (uhu hu hu)  
The heat was on (burninâ€™), rising to the top, huh!  
Everybody's goin' strong (uhu hu hu)  
And that is when my spark got hot  
I heard somebody say  
  
Burn baby burn! - Disco inferno!  
Burn baby burn! - Burn that mama down, yoh!  
Burn baby burn! - Disco inferno!  
Burn baby burn! - Burn that mama down  
Burnin'!
