We were walking in the outskirts of Bucharest (cab driver refused to traverse the road) to a meeting at an association for Roma craftspeople. In the distance, there was a sound of hundreds of dogs barking. Our local friend told us it was two gigantic dog pounds the city had created, as in the recent years, they had been rounding up the stray dogs in Bucharest (the city has a reputation for strays and for the risk of being bit by strays as well). Sidenote: locals are quite attached to their neighborhood dogs and were hiding dogs on the roofs of their buildings. So, we were trotting along and suddenly we encountered a number of huge marijuana plants. Our local friend had an explaination for this too: "Ah, they used to produce hemp in abundance in Romania!" Hey! Who did he think we were? This was no simple hemp production. He posed next to a pot plant the size of a Christmas tree, Jason gathered some goodies and we moved on. This was skunk weed and for the rest of the day, we stunk. We only found out later possession is not taken lightly in Romania - thankfully, we did not find out the hard way. Hemp twine to toast not being caught. Do you know North Korea is one of only two places in the world where marijuana is legal?
