Considering we were working on a German collection, I found it most necessary to include a beer accessory. I was lucky to encounter the Hermetus. Flip off, unscrew, seal - it can all be done with the Hermetus. Slide it over the bottle opening until it stays put, sealing your bottle tight. I am not a huge beer drinker so I used it to seal a bottle of Prosecco; works great! Nifty instructional graphics on the top in case you become too tipsy to recall. Drink beer. Drink booze.
