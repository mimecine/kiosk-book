The supplier of this tea first opened for business more than 350 years ago. They specialize in tea from Uji, a famous region for tea close to Kyoto. Two of the three historic and honorable tea schools in Japan - Omotesenke and Urasenke - prefer their tea. Hoji-cha ("roasted tea") is a green tea from Japan. It is different from other teas because it is roasted over charcoal, giving the leaves a brown appearance despite the fact that they are actually green-tea leaves. The process was first performed in Kyoto in the 1920s and it is still popular today. Hoji-cha is well-known for its flavor, clarity, and low caffeine.
