Horezu ceramics are produced only in the town of Horezu with the majority of the producers being located on one stretch of road outside of the village. House after house has ceramics displayed on the outer walls. The craft has traditionally been passed down from generation to generation within families, since as early as the 1700s. The potters we chose to visit were the Mischiu family, whose work we first noticed at the Museum of the Romanian Peasant in Bucharest, which is, by the way, an incredible museum to visit. Traditionally, the men dig up and sort the clay, as well as spin the ceramics and the women decorate them with primitive tools which include a bull's horn, goose quills and a number of metal tips. The glaze is applied with such while the object is spinning on the potter's wheel. It naturally takes years of experience and every piece is unique. The craft is considered so valuable it is included on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List, the only object from Romania which is included. Visiting there was nothing short of overwhelming. The large plate is the size of a standard dinner plate and the small for a side dish, but I feel these are best used as serving plates. Please let us know what plate you are interested in and if we no longer have the exact one, we will send you images of similar. It is hard to choose and it is equally as hard for us to let them go. We chose each one with food in mind.
