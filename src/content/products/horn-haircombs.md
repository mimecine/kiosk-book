Sometimes horn is white, sometimes it is translucent and shiny. For thousands of years it has been made into great combs. These three will work for all types of hair that needs combing, from board-straight to napalicious, even just wavy. Bedhead is so 2000s. Comb that mess and get ready for the new decade.
