I'll tell you, with climate change the fly population seems to be growing, add to that mosquitos too. Without the cold of winter nothing is knocking those little buddies off and they do multiply. I hesitate to swat and kill most things, however, my primitive soul snaps into action when I encounter any flying thing that lands on my mouth, buzzes in my ear or bites, except for bees, they need cuddling. I always found fly swatters to be most dreary things, akin to having a miniature guillotine in the house, but the handle on this unit is so brilliant I made an exception to the rule. Defend ones sanity.
