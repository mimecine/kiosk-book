When was your last visit to a motel? That's one refreshing thing about Florida: it's so easy to stay in a motel. There are plenty of them! While KIOSK doesn't yet have a motel, we are excited to offer this motel key chain so you can relive the experience of walking into a divey motel with Home Depot furniture and frilly curtains (cute!), and remember those places you stayed at when you were broke, out on an American adventure. Remember sleeping in your clothes, using a t-shirt as a pillowcase, then burning it afterward? Actually, I'm just kidding. Although I have done that, I didn't need to on our last trip to Florida. We stayed in some really decent motels and I have some great memories of this type of key chain. Note that if lost, we do pay for the return postage to KIOSK. Not bad! So if you lose your keys with this key chain, call us. We should have them. Note the number: totally random, but only one for each room. No repeats, we only have one location!
