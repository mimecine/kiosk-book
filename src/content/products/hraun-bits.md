The falls were big, over one hundred meters high, but we knew we had to get closer and climb to the top, no matter how much there was a risk of a landslide. It had been raining for months, years, weeks, or was it days? Lava, or “Hraun”, created in the ‘70s, is one of the top Icelandic candies. Essentially Ædi without the coconut. Good for people who hate tropical fruits or any kind of Tiki torch. Produced by Goa, established in 1968, the second-largest candy manufacturer in Iceland, the founder came from Noi Sirius, the largest manufacturer. We got to the top. Hraun roars.
