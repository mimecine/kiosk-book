Made in the Bronx! Yes! The Bronx! A hula hoop with a New York City pedigree! Take that, California! According to the manufacturer, at certain times of the year they make thousands a day, and, in total, tens of thousands a year! Who knew! In production since 1940! Can you jump through your hoop? Skip with it? Run down the street while jumping through it? Swing it around your neck? Your leg? Your wrist? Your finger? Ankle? Knee? Elbow? Two dudes, Knerr and Melin, are credited with the modern hula hoop. They started the Wham-O company from their Los Angeles garage in 1948 and quickly trademarked the name Hula Hoop; this happened just after they invented the Frisbee. The HH was a hit, 20 million were sold in the first six months! It was a quick craze! Sexy, too; in Japan they actually once banned the HH due to indecent movements while using. People get crazy with the HH: 105 hoops were spun by Jin Linlin of China on October 28, 2007, and the largest HH ever spun was 51.5 feet, talk about engineering! Stop... think about that. YES, ours has beads inside and makes the little "pebbles in a tumbler" noise, it's essential, especially if you want to be hypnotized or to hypnotize others with your hoop!
