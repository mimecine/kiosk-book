Simply called hunaja or “honey” - direct and to the point, in that lovely Finnish way. There are no indigenous honey bees in Finland; the first bees were imported from Estonia and Sweden in the 18th century. Most bees are kept in the south of the country but beekeepers are working as far north as the polar circle. One can imagine the quality of the honey, as most natural things in Finland are of a high standard - the nature is still pure. This is a flower honey made by a company working since 1969. Good, simple, basic stuff.
