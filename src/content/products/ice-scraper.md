Winter has a big long moment in Sweden and of course there are solutions for every type of snow and ice. Personally, I was always nostalgic for the simple ice scrapers of days gone by. I have never understood why they look so high tech these days - kind of a cross between a razor and a climbing tool...stupid! Then one day I realized my dreams had been answered - there was no reason to be ashamed of my ice scraper, this one was so basic and suited my nostalgia perfectly. It is straightforward, one end for scraping and one for brushing, nothing in-between. Now I only need a car! Oh well...makes a fine object for the bookshelf and a decent back scratcher too.
