Ideally speaking, why bother keeping notes at all? In an ideal world, we would remember everything we come across and, idealistically, have no need to write a thing. But being idealistic is a bit unrealistic, and in fact, I think buying these two ideal notebooks will give your brain a lot more potential for idealism. Ideal? Deal?
