Toothbrushes made in New Jersey! According to Wikipedia, in 2003 the toothbrush was voted the number one invention Americans could not live without. Our dental hygiene is pretty good here, I must say. Traveling to different places in the world, one really encounters a variety of good and bad teeth, and after living in Sweden for some years, my first check-up here was loaded with sad news - cavities! I'm still digging out of the decay! My dentist was appalled, and in addition always tries to push one whitening agent or another on me. Americans are obsessed with white teeth, what about whites of the eyes? Shoot when you see the whites of their teeth / eyes, we are all gun-crazy here, too. Knowing what I just told you, you must figure American toothbrushes are engineered to the max and the tops. Tops this toothbrush is; however, the slightly subliminal message, "Improve," on the handle is what makes magic happen in the bathroom. Every time you reach for it you hear "Improve," "Improve," "Improve." A slight dose of anxiety at a key moment makes for more successful brushing every time. In case you have as hard a time choosing the color of your toothbrush as I do - since childhood it's always been a fun/painful, very considered event - we narrowed it down to our favorite color as a service to you. You'll have to take our word for it - this is the most lovely.
