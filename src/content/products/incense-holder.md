While I am writing I am breathing and I am meditating on incense and the burner in the shape of a lotus, India's national flower, and the incense is simultaneously helping me meditate. Being that incense is so common in India, one can find hundreds of types of incense burners. Almost immediately I chose the lotus as it is the most basic and simple, it was at home and it was at RIMYI next to Patanjali. The tricky part was deciding which lotus-shaped burner I wanted. Scrutiny can be a curse. Once I decided, I was told that type is only found in Mumbai. At which point I raised an eyebrow and walked the markets finding enough for KIOSK. Every Hindu temple and shrine has an incense holder to purify the air and make it pleasant for the deity. Be your own god.
