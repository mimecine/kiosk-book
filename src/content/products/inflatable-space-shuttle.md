Watching the space shuttle Discovery take off on its trip to ISS on March 15 was a truly life-changing experience. Supposedly one of the most beautiful launches ever, it took place right after dusk so it started in the dark spewing out fire enough to warm the hearts of the people of the world, ascending until it got hit by the last rays of the sun, coloring the smoke in pink shades. The significance of the shuttle to science became very clear when we sat with our eyes fixed to the by-then tiny bright spot which, all of a sudden, disappeared - the engines had shut off as it had reached orbit - 15 minutes after the launch. This one wonâ€™t take you that far in reality, but in a daydream it recently sent me off on a to visit Saturn. Who knows where it will carry you. Support NASA, support science, dream.
