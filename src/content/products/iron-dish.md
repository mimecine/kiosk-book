Only in Japan can they make a highly sophisticated item like this in the shape of a hamburger bun. Yes, that is exactly what you see in front of you - a sesame-sprinkled hamburger bun, all iron. But quite seriously this object was made by the Suzuki family, authorized artisans for the Lord of Nambu since 1625. Their 13th generation master iron maker received the title of "intangible cultural asset". The bun is actually made to be an ashtray but why smoke? A modern object produced by the owners of Higashiya in Tokyo in conjunction with a craftsman. Higashiya is one of the best Japanese sweet shops in Tokyo; we suggest you go. We are very pleased to offer their things this Christmas.
