It's not possible to say  
there is a prettier dustpan.  
Made since 1918,  
it is now discontinued.  
Note the hole in the handle  
so it can be hung out of the way.  
The angle of the pan is calculated.  
The length of the handle means no stooping.  
Better than cardboard.  
I have seen dustpans come and go,  
now it is sad to see this one leave us.  
I will keep a stockpile  
for my personal needs.
