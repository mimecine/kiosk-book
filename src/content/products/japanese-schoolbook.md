A notebook made of recycled paper. The creator is a passionate believer in all things pleasing to the mind and senses. The tone of the paper makes the book easy on the eyes. The lines are spaced to be a proper distance for comfortable writing. The paper is top quality, produced with a finish that supports the touch of a pencil and the whole shebang is archival. The company has been in business for 55 years, operating at the same location in the wholesale district of Tokyo. Have we said enough? This is not your average schoolbook, but something designed for excellent studies and sharpened minds.
