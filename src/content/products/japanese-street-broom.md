Please note the length of this broom -  
it is short!  
Do you really need a long handle?  
My opinion is yes, if you are sweeping a large area.  
No, if you are doing a dainty zone.  
In Japan, they are in a dainty zone.  
Living in a city, we are dainty.  
You people in the countryside do not attempt to sweep your mile-long drive  
with this broom as you will miss dinner and we don't want to be responsible.  
You know, it's a big sky vs. little sky kind of thing.
