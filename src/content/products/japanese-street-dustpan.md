All over Japan you will find this pan  
it is called a “railroad dustpan”  
as they are used in subway and train stations.  
Yes, the name tells no lies,  
this is where we saw them.  
Now,  
this one has been discontinued  
so we are looking for a replacement.  
But this green is very beautiful.  
As progress marches on,  
there will be less dustpans and men  
and more machines.  
Science fiction tells us this.
