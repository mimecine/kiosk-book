For Mini-Exhibition # 2 artist Jason Rosenberg sat at KIOSK and made beautiful pouches and other items out of plastic bags from his collection along with bags others provided. He continues to make pouches from his never ending, growing collection of beautiful plastic bags. Nothing says "I love you" more than a recycled bag pouch.X
