The faux brushed steel look of the Cuisinart coffee grinder really bothered me, sitting in my gaze every morning while I starred intensely on the coffee zone. I couldn't take that logo on the terrible material, but the grinder itself - well - grinds coffee really OK. I used to paint my appliances and unsightly things decades ago, so what else could I do but take comfort in the brush and I went for it. - MR

_This is an actual grinder. Just bettered._  
  
_As this item is hand done every one is slightly different of course, however, white and red are what I'm into right now.  Made to order, but it's fastish._
