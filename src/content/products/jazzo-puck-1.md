It's amazing what these little voice assistants can do. Order home delivery, tell you the mileage of your last car, offer to sell you another voice assistant - among thousands of other useful things. Personally, I use it for the mundane: playing music, setting a cooking timer, and converting between metric and inferior units of measurements. I have asked when next high tide is and Alexa duly replied. I should be able to live without it but I don't want to. Yet, I don't want to host a hunk of colorless molded plastic pretending to be a savvy designed object. So, with some inspiration from my teens, M. Margiela, and Tom Sachs, I present to you a less disgraceful voice blob, the Amazon Echo in full form yet decorated to become something more. I can imagine it in bed with you! - MR

_This is a fully functional Amazon Echo Dot (4th gen). Just bettered._  
  
_As this item is hand done every one is slightly different of course, however, white and red are what I'm into right now.  Made to order, but it's fastish._
