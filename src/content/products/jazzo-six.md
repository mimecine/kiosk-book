You need some power! We all need it to power through the day. I get sapped of power when the strip delivering it is black or white shiny plastic, like they all are. I try to hide them behind furniture, in boxes, throwing dirty underwear on them - anything to keep the unsightly unsightlyness away from my view. So I started to decorate them slightly. Just enough to not be a statement, but duller and a little splash of color makes my day just a little better. Believe me when I say that my smile is broader when I plug in my electrical crap in this strip. 

_This is an actual powerstrip. Just bettered._  

_As this item is hand done every one is slightly different of course, however, white and red are what I'm into right now.  Made to order, but it's fastish._
