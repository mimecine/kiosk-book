Delicious, buttery and crisp shortbread. First created by a baker outside Alkmaar. His product became well known once the business was sold in 1924 and the new owner made a very successful advertising campaign. Sometimes that is all it takes. In this particular case, the product was really good too. Translated as "Jew Cookie" the name has created a ruckus in the Netherlands from time to time. No one knows how the cookie got its name. One possibility is the recipe came from a Jewish family. Another is the originator of the cookie had the surname _de Joode_. Comes in a tin for freshness. The Dutch have a thing for foods in tins, good for reuse.
