You know, people always want to know the backstory behind our articles. For this item, there isn't one! Guess what: we were hungry and finally found a grocery store in the inner city of Guimar√£es; all the supermarkets have been pushed out to shopping malls, and I grabbed the first thing that looked pretty to me. That's it. I was hungry, I grabbed the pretty item, it tasted good, so we have them here for you. I hope you get plenty of sweet dreams and enjoy these cookies. People agree they are pretty.
