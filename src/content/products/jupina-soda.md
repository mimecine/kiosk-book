Everyone told us to go to Little Havana when in Miami and, of course, we went. We arrived by lunchtime, tired and thirsty, so we took to one of the local eateries to try their grub. Tasty, yes, very, but what set us off was their sugar-loaded sodas. Later in the day, we both realized we couldnâ€™t throw our cans away - they just looked too nice in the car. We brought some with us for you too. Pineapple flavor.
