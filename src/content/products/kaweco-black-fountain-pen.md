Kaweco was founded in Heidelberg, Germany in the 1890s. The Kaweco Sport Pen was developed in the mid-1920s as a pen for ladies, officers, and sportspersons. The Sport was suited to sport, service, and social dress, due to its compact size and ability to tuck conveniently into a pocket. I carry one in my purse. It looks very professional, and I feel like a reporter on an North African adventure in the 1920s, tossing my hair I take out my pen! It is endlessly refillable with standard ink cartridges. Less waste is good stuff! Each pen comes with one blue ink cartridge. Refills can be purchased at any respectable stationary supply.
