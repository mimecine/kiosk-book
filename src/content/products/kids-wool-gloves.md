There is a town in Transylvania called Viscri. In that town, lots of ladies form a women's cooperative knitting socks and gloves - lots of them, and other wool things too. The knit like wildfire - by hand, no machines. The wool is from the local shepherds and is spun locally. The Saxon village, falling into disrepair after the revolution when many Germans left to Germany, received a revival from the organization, the Mihai Eminescu Trust (MET) beginning in 2002. Implementing a program they call "The Whole Village Project", the MET has worked to restore a good number of the houses in the village, encouraging others to do the same. To support the local economy, they established a number of cottage industries, the knitting cooperative being one such. When you buy their gloves and socks you are supporting more people and work than you can imagine.
