In the kid's wool mittens description I told you about the Mihai Eminescu Trust - that was serious stuff. These socks are made by the same women's cooperative they helped establish. Good stuff too. Now, let me tell you, these socks are a doorbuster and I mean the kind that kicks in the door to get into the store. Give to kids all winter long, give them warm and cosy socks. No excuses.
