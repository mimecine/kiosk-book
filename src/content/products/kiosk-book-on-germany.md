120 pages documenting the KIOSK Germany collection and our resources from the trip. The first in a series, we planned on making a book for every KIOSK collection. 100% self-published at the local copy shop, hand numbered and stamped, nothing fancy but a pretty good documentation of a place, people and things at this moment in time. If you like KIOSK you'll like the book! Money Back Guarantee if you are not 100% satisfied and unlike PayPal we don't charge you for the guarantee! FROM 2007!
