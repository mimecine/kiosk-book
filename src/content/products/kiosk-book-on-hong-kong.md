The third book we produced with the help of our local copy shop which has since shut down. Features the Hong Kong collection as well as our tips and trips inside Hong Kong, which we strolled and ran around in for 2 1/2 weeks. Places to go to although by now most have likely changed or been torn down. We also took the time to describe the neighborhoods in good detail as these things take longer to change. Features Hong Kong island, Kowloon and the New Territories everything we saw from Sham Shui Po to the Star Ferry. From 2008!
