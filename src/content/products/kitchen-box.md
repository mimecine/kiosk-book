Here is a house traditionally used for aging cheeses and meats. The air wafts over them through the mesh, while the handle and netting helps keep the food out of reach of unwanted munchers. When we get a new apartment, we may just use them as kitchen cabinets, all lined up, hanging from ropes or mounted on a wall; there are hoops on the backside to hang the box as well. Marco thinks it will be very efficient to be able to move the cabinets around \- remember, he's the one who built an entire room at KIOSK on wheels \- while I, on the other hand, am not sure of the value of moving cabinets, in real life. Either way, these boxes are certainly an easy kitchen to install yourself: one for glasses, one for plates, one for dried goods, and so on.
