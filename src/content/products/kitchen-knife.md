Zing! Only nine fingers left! Well, ten fingers are more than the nine lives a cat has. Yeah, this knife is really sharp. Handmade for 40-plus years by the elder Mr. Au, these knives intrigued us with their handsomely simple sharpening streaks. According to Mr. Au, this specific knife is particularly good for cutting meat and chopping vegetables. I have used mine for more than seven years and haven’t needed to sharpen it. It cut through my Teflon cutting mat. So please use on wood or go gently! This thing is sharp! To sharpen, use a dry corundum stone and file with many long strokes in one direction and apply light pressure. Be sure to dry the knife after washing to protect the handle.
