Kulfi, or the Indian equivalent of ice cream, comes in a variety of flavors. Nectar is sweet. Joy is sweet. Kulfi is sweet. Sweetness or sweet taste is the only taste universally regarded as pleasurable. Enjoy your ice cream / kulfi with a little spoon shaped like a shovel, perfect for cutting into a dense block. As for flavors, I prefer malai, pistachio, and mango, when the Alphonso is in season. If not eaten on a plate with a spoon, then on a stick. I can feel it running down my hand in the Indian summer heat. It's all about what we enjoy. Your sweetness is my weakness. Comes in a set of 12 for big parties.
