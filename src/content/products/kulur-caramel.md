Kulur: caramel wrapped in a delicate layer of soft chocolate made of milk from Icelandic cows. If you dare to compare this to a Milk Dud, youâ€™re in trouble. The quality of the Kulur goes beyond. The other day when we were organizing the stock in the closet I had a complete sugar low. It was a freaky, sweaty, shaky moment. I think being surrounded by so much sugar and chocolate made my body panic or cry for some more. Just before passing out, I ripped open a pack of Kulur. As the floor was getting closer and closer, I poured a bunch down into my mouth, down the hatch. It saved me.
