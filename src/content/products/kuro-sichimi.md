Around our house we call Kuro Shichimi  
the spice of our life,  
or that spice that adds life.  
As I am writing you, I am eating  
a cold baked potato.  
I was tempted to cover the thing  
in slices of cheese,  
but let's face it,  
cheese goes to the waist!  
Butter was the next fix, but ditto on that.  
One does not have to wonder why the Japanese are so fit  
with a diet light on the dairy.  
Life has to be enjoyed, however.  
In this respect, the spicy and savory from Japan rocks.  
Pepper, sesame, lemony, not too hot -  
all in one bite.  
It's this.  
Made by a business established in 1704.
