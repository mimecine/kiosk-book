Designed by the store Kwikshop in Berlin and printed locally. Perfect for organization that begins on any day of the year. Great, as I just LOVE organization. The pages are divided into blank "days." Fill in the date and use the perforated page end for a daily to-do list. The Kwik team made this as a result of a time-management class one of them took - it works really great as a project journal. It will last for 3 months or a quarter of a year - enough time to get a routine going or complete a long-term goal. Much better than scraps of paper - I am testing the book on my husband Marco to see if it has any impact on his behavior. Fingers crossed.
