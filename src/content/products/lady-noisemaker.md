Ring a little ring ding. What's the line in "Dancer in the Dark" where Bjork goes on a tirade of jip, boom, bang, skip-dee-dos? And why does she do it anyway? Ho-hum, that movie was a tough one, thanks, Lars baby. But back to OUR reality. Do you need a noisemaker? Yes! And do you know why? Why! Because New Year's Eve is quickly approaching and when the clock strikes midnight you need something to make a hoot with! And if you are not into New Year's Eve and sleep through it, (you're one of those, huh?), then how about for the "friend" whose lovely little kiddies drive you nuts? Oh, the perfect gift for them to latch on to and provide hours of parental abuse in the shape of a pretty little Mexican lady in Spanish costume.
