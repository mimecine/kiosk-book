How do you reach into the deep vases and bottles you have? It is even hard to find a cheap plastic variant of a bottlebrush at the market. From Japan we offered an upscale one (see the Japan section) but this is just as beautiful and a third of the price. Made by an association that employees visually impaired people to produce their products by hand, we also feature the companyâ€™s coffee brush and birch dish brush.
