I recently went to an indie-rock show. It was pretty mellow, on a college campus known for its rowdy crowd (are they all known for their rowdiness nowadays?). In the middle of the show, the performer threw out a bunch of tambourines for the kids to play along. The song was one of her hits where the tambourine features center. But the kids were really banging around, basically all playing Jimi Hendrix-style solos. Shaky, shaky, bam, bam, bam! If those neophytes could only have had a few of these models in their hands to remind them of the pastoral and contemplative nature of the tambourine, the song may have been saved. Don't you love the photo? Meow!
