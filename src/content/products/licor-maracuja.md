How can you resist getting drunk and having a captive audience at the same time? It's the classic woman-and-booze combination, a beautiful girl all boozed up! Literally! One guy I know said he'd like to see a less innocent version of our lady, something a bit updated, and lose the flower with the innocence! Hey, I like her hydrangea bouquet and her rosy, slightly drunken look - romance! But I am not a guy, nor interested in girls... Passion fruit is one of the principal crops of the Azores,and the majority of what is grown is used to make this popular liquor, "Licor Maracuj√°." It has a sweet taste of fruit, hmm, let me try some more, zzzzzzz. The booze comes out of her bun! Let it roll, baby!
