Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, and apparently a cigarette paper too - interesting. I don't smoke but I have heard these are good. I am wild about anything licorice and I like the packaging. Friends have tested it for me and it is approved. It's not good to smoke - think of this as a nice commemorative item for something of the past.
