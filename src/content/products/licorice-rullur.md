A “Rullur” looks like a ruler when it is unrolled. We measured it and the length is hovering at one foot, so our conclusion is “Rullur” equals “ruler” even though the literal translation is “reels”. The only way to eat a “Rullur” is to quickly devour it with your two front teeth like a crazy rabbit or lawnmower. Bite bite bite fast. As far as taste, it tastes like licorice! Good and soft, too! “Apollo Licorice” was originally called Drift when it was created in 1965. The original owners of the company were named Adalheidur and Peter and the product was called Polo Lakkrís. Over time it took the first letters of the owners’ names, becoming AP Polo Lakkrís and then APOLLO LAKKRÍS. Time marches on. Progress waits for no man.
