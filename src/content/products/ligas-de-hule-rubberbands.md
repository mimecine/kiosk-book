As a follow-up to the Japanese rubber bands...The paper quality and printing are amazingly basic. We found them in an office supply store in Mexico City. Many were dusty and damaged, but the owner understood right away our interest in having perfect examples; a like mind, what a relief! We could only find a few boxes and contacted the factory for more, but they were unable to help. We tried. Typical scenario in Mexico: what you see is what you get. Great rubber quality!
