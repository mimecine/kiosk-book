Established in 1894 and originally located in what is now Russia, the convent was relocated in 1939 during the Winter War to what is Finnish Karelia. In the 1960´s the nuns began making candles, eventually making an agreement to supply all the Orthodox churches in Finland (approx 1.1% of the population, it is a tiny movement but yet one of the two official national churches in Finland). The sisters continue the production today at a small factory in the convent. Lintula is the only Finnish Orthodox convent. It was a peaceful place to stay overnight during our trip. I find sometimes the best nights traveling are spent at convents or monasteries. If a room is offered, 9 out of 10 times it is a good, inexpensive and clean place. Although I would venture to call myself an atheist I still respect most religions. While in Lintula we witnessed an Orthodox mass. The prayer was like song, very beautiful and poetic with these candles burning. An interesting performance.
