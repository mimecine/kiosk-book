I love objects that are made to resemble the things they are made to do things to. For example, a cheese box that is in the shape of a cheese, a citrus press that looks like an orange and in this case, a lobster cracker that looks like a lobster claw. You can't miss the message, nothing subliminal here, or is there just a touch of surrealism present? After all, it was the great Dali who made a telephone receiver in the form of a lobster. For whatever reason Dali felt lobsters had strong sexual connotations and associated them with sexual pleasure and pain. Are you buying / giving a lobster cracker or are you giving something more? It is after all a cracker in the shape of a lobster, a lobster which must be cracked. This is in fact, the perfect holiday gift.
