Clear lollies made in the traditional way using candy molds that are a hundred years old; the maker has a collection of 300 of them. How fast you pour the lollies determines how clear they will be; clearness = perfection. Colors: clear, red and green. The tradition was brought to America by German immigrants who historically produced them at Christmas, hanging the little ones in the tree. We chose these forms to represent Massachusetts, the state we focused on for this first collection: windjammer boat = boat = the Mayflower; bear = black bears = the Berkshires; squirrel = the famous black squirrels of Westfield. Flavor = Sugar Beauty = 100%!
