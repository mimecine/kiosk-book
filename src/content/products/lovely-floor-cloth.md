Used for cleaning the floor on the end of a hard broom but we prefer it on the table as a mat or as a kitchen towel for hot pans. Not good for drying dishes! An old fashioned weave of very basic cotton and so simple and unrefined we cannot believe it is made in Sweden, we thought they were only into linen! What a relief!
