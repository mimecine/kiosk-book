A soft felt bowl made by Pia Wallén, one of Sweden's most well-known designers. She designed this piece to sit on a table to hold keys, mittens, bits of paper, business cards, etc. But what she found was it worked best was for her cats! They loved it, so it became their home; they curl up right inside of it and it holds them quite snug! Designer!
