A number and magic: "If you are angry, sing the alphabet," is what my fortune cookie said tonight. It made me think about magic, as fortune cookies often do have very relevant, serendipitous advice. While I was writing, and humming the alphabet, I followed my superstitious ways and lit a number 8 candle (my favorite number) and wrote to you. Magic candles are good for everything from seances to birthdays. Ok, really for birthday seances. Oh, that sounds sad. Scratch that. I never said that. I mean, they are really good for HAPPY BIRTHDAYS (to you, if it is your birthday today). Every visitor who comes to KIOSK on their birthday gets their age for free! Just Ask! ID required! Don't mess with the magic candle, it has tricks and sparkles.
