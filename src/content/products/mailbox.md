Mail...Box. That's what it says on the front. We haven't figured out what it is used for but it's such a beautiful object we needed to share it with you. Maybe you can find a place for one? Do you get mail? I mean the non-digital kind. I think outside near the front door is a good option, but inside for intra-household notes could also work. This type of mailbox is all over Hong Kong. In fact, with the exception of a few handmade beauties, it is the only mailbox we noticed. The cutouts can vary slightly but the size and shape remains the same. Perhaps it is a postal standard or something that evolved as "the" standard over time. We first spotted it in Sham Shui Po â€” a part of Kowloon that has an overrepresentation of immigrants and is not the wealthiest area (it's actually the poorest and has the greatest number of aged people) of Hong Kong. Not surprisingly, people in Sham Shui Po were also among the friendliest and swiftest we met. This neighborhood is hard-hit by pollution; at times I was stunned by how difficult it was to breathe. I am itchy to see gasoline disappear as a fuel! Never too soon!
