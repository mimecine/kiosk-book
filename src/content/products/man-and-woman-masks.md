Ok, what the heck are these? Children hate them, so they are definitely NOT for kids. I on the other hand think they are beautiful characters. Eyes bugging and with their grins, they come straight from an R.Crumb novel of 1930s characters. Don't fall asleep with both eyes closed, they are watching you and smiling and wanting to be your friend all night long.
