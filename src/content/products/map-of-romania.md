Being on the trip was not even half the battle, planning the trip was more than the other half. Are you one of those people who goes with the flow when traveling? If you say _DA_, then I say _NU_, because 4 days later you are going to find yourself halfway through the trip you imagined. Google Maps was calculating what seemed to be short distances at long times. I mean, what looked like 2 hours in distance was coming in at 6-7 hours. But then, you have to remember, two short stretches of highway in the whole country...which means the majority of the roads are only two lanes. Walls of mountains to cross that ring more than half the nation, horse and carts, potholes, potholes and potholes, trains that have a high speed of 35 km an hour (22 miles), cars that have a high speed of 50 (32 miles). Trucks, trucks and glorious trucks. This is not an average driving adventure. We planned, we mapped it out, we planned again, over and over again. Two weeks stretched to three and eventually turned into almost 4. I funnily swore we did not have to worry about the infamous dangers of nighttime driving and then, weeks later, we found ourselves driving at night so often I nicknamed the trip "The Romania by Night Tour" while on hairpin turns facing down oncoming trucks. It was glorious. It's no wonder Romanians need to have good navigation skills - this handy little map with each regional capital marked helps. Fill in the dots.
