The strangest thing was I was in Vermont, where maple is all the rage, and no one told me about this stuff. I have to wonder, because there is no reason why everyone out there who likes to drink cold beverages and does not greatly dislike maple should not know about Vermont Sweetwater. The story is pretty simple: we were hanging out at the Parker Pie at the end of the day - they have this great grocery attached to their place - and I spotted a bottle of Vermont Sweetwater in their cooler. I thought, "What the heck, I like maple and I like seltzer and I wanted something cold to drink." Simple thoughts from a simple mind. I was surprised to find it is carbonated maple sap, not seltzer with maple syrup added, as I assumed. It's just the sap from the tree with a bit of carbonation. No joke. That's it, and only 35 calories per 8 oz. serving, vs. Coke, which is 97. Plus it's cool drinking sap from a tree. Wow, I feel like I am becoming a bit of a preacher of Vermont Sweetwater, I wonder what's going on?
