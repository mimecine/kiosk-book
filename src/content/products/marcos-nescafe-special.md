Nestlé is doing something funny. Everywhere in the world you can find this particular strain of instant bless. The ready in a minute jolt of energy, warmth and mental correction. But not in the US. Why, I never understood, but I always felt I needed to introduce the future that never comes to this country. I drink this in abundance in order to be able to churn out descriptions like this one, staying awake after waking up, and finally before I go to sleep to avoid oversleeping the next morning. It’s also an essential ingredient for bak- ing certain things, should you ever have the crazy idea to engage in that activity.
