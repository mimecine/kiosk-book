Cleanliness is next to prettiness. Make yourself new again. Fly among the poppies and fields of green. Founded in Braga in 1894, the Saboaria e Perfumaria Confian√ßa continues to go strong. Opening the box lights up our noses in the office. The scent is very fresh and floral, slightly sweet. Unique. Clean yourself off and fly away. Today is the day to fly clean and pretty.
