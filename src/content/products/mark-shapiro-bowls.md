There is a lot of pottery being produced in our country - in fact, it seems pottery, sweet jams and sometimes honey are the only products still produced in nation's like ours. For the most part, all of this production is hobby-level, someone who decided late in life to abandon their I-don’t-like-my-job occupation and go for their true calling of making wholesome jams or genially inspired blobs of clay. Mark Shapiro is an exception to that rule; he is a dedicated potter who established his home and studio in Massachusetts in the 80s. He gives his work an abundance of thought and shares his knowledge and creativity via teaching and through the objects he makes. The bowls were created with comfort in mind; he wanted something for his family to kick back and relax with - a bowl to cradle for comfort. Eating should be an experience filled with conversation, not a formal affair. The finish is a Shino glaze; the color was chosen to enhance the food; as he put it, to “let the food decorate the pot.” Heating a wood-fired kiln is a 22-hour affair, and being that it holds 1,000 pieces at a time, it does not happen often. Mark fires these bowls twice a year. If you order now, they will be shipped at the end of November.
