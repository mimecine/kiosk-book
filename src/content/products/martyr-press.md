What to say? Another kitchen item I have no idea if you or anyone else outside of its motherland will ever use but I was drawn to it for that particular reason and hence you find this at our shop now. Used to make cookies, pasta or pretzels depending on which region you are in, from what we are told every house in Romania has one. All are called mucenici or "martyr" in English - the 8-shape symbolizes a human figure, representing some saints and celebrated on March 9th by the Orthodox community. The factory which makes them is owned by an inventor who has a factory pretty much because he has a fixation with machines, in a good way. He and Marco had a lot in common even though they had no way to communicate. At the factory, they produce everything from these guys to decent-sized metal agricultural devices to a hand-held tool that splatters plaster on walls for decorative reasons. Once you start clicking it it's hard to stop. Roll out the dough, press into and pop out. Good to use with leftover pie crust or to make mini-cookies.
