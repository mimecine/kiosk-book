Alright, where to begin with this story? Jason visited us in France in August and really wanted to duck over to Albissola to visit Asger Jorn's house (member of the CoBrA art movement), the renowned ceramic factory Mazzotti and another ceramic producer. In the 1930s Albissola was the center of Italian Futurist ceramics, lots of artists were working there- Fontana, Lam, Munari etc- and beautiful things they made indeed, as exemplified by these two stellar candlestick holders, today produced by Mazzotti from the original designs. (Note the unique hand-sponged glazing technique.) Summer is summer and we were lazy so we made it to the sea but not to Albissola. While at the beach, Jason decided to return and visit us in October and we figured, as we have an Italian collection we are working on, why not visit Albissola and all of the above. And so, we picked up Jason in Genoa, spent one night and a day in that fabulously odd town and drove to Albissola where we met Tullio, the grandson of the man who created these candlesticks while working alongside other Futurist members in his workshop. Although we had come so far, that day, we arrived late, did not make it to the Jorn house and we were short on time with Tullio, we did have a fabulous dinner however. At the end of our meal we were feeling jolly and unanimously decided to return the following day to visit the Jorn house and spend some time with Tullio. And then, mission accomplished. Tullio and Mazzotti are fabulous. I urge you to visit. I'll tell you where to eat. See his work. He is a great host and open to ideas. Artists continue to work at Mazzotti and Tullio heads, in a very generous way, a company I admire. Thank you to Jason for bringing us there and for finding these beauties with us.
