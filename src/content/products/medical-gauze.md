Have you ever seen such beautiful packaging? Yellow is to me the commercial color of Mexico. Found at the Paris Pharmacy in downtown Mexico City, a landmark in itself with an overhead conveyor belt system in place since the 30s and 10,000 square feet of pharmaceutical goods of all kinds. You know what they say about Mexican pharmacies. Some people would consider the Paris Pharmacy to be heaven on Earth.
