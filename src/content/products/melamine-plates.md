Since we visited the factory Marco has not stopped talking about these pieces. It's almost become a mantra every time I want to pass on a product he feels we should include. It goes like, "Remember those really amazing melamine pieces from Portugal we should never have passed on, the ones that would have really made the collection crème de la crème?" or "Remember those melamine plates, the ones I really wanted us to include. If we had bought those, I bet we would be living in Greece by now." Or: "Remember when I said we should include those melamine pieces, the ones that were so cool, that were made from scrap, and represented everything I believe in, above everything else, in the world." Yeah, it goes like that, and that's only the beginning. So, when I found the opportunity to create a collection based on things we passed over, boy, was I stoked to put the kibosh on his "remember-when" lines. These plates are produced from recycled melamine scraps. The cups, spoons, and ashtrays are, too. All are vintage and one-of-a-kind. Each pile of scrap combines into its own special, pressed scrap form for your joyful, never-ending, life-changing (according to some) use.
