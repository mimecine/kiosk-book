Memorandum books made for the U.S. military \- simple, lined books to be put in the front or back pocket. No messing around, buster \- when the U.S. military talks, it means business and my business is your business like nobody's noodle business, so look sharp when I am talking to you and stand at attention when you take notes. I think that if I was drafted into the U.S. military and I was told to stand at attention, the only thing I could do is stand in Tadasana - know what I mean? Please note the notebooks do not match 100%, but are very pretty and the script looks like a ladies' underwear advertisement - a nice coming together of yin and yang.
