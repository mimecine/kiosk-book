A game.  
It's simple:  
put the cards down -  
but face up! -  
in a pile.  
Keep a few in each players' hands.  
The object is to toss one card down and flip the cards in the pile over.  
The ones you flip, you keep.  
Every card has points on it, but  
it's about the illustrations, man.  
Sumo, Samurai, Geisha, etc...
