Innocent? It looks easy but it's not, it's really not, I promise you. If you or anyone you know needs a challenging entertainment for a period of hours, sit them down with these few wooden pieces and the booklet that comes with them and bet them a few bucks they won't make it from front to back. If there is anyone in your life you would like some peace and quiet from, ask them to take the challenge. If not, then I suggest you challenge yourself.
