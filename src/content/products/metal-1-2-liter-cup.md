I am a fairly exacting chef; Marco, on the other hand, refuses to use any sort of recipe. I can put a handwritten, cherished, age-old family text in front of him and he will toss it to the side with a look of disgust. "Tell me the dish and I will make it! I don't need direction!" Some people are like this. Other people, like me, are less -shall I say - intuitive, and enjoy a blend of following a recipe and going with the gut. To me directions (recipes) set the foundation of the food to come in the future. We have friends from all over the world and often I get recipes from European friends. However, they don't use our system, they enjoy the metric system, and I enjoy having my fastidious ways and pulling out my half liter or quarter liter (1 liter was not necessary as doubling the half works, but halving the half does not work by me) measuring cup to make sure I get the proper quantity required. Marco, on the otherhand, pours straight from the carton into the bowl. Use this cup if you want precision, or use it for other, more "loose" things too.
