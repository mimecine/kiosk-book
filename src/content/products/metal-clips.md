Old fashioned, but still practical and functional - most commonly used for laundry, but helpful all over the house. These clips speak for themselves: hundreds of uses and beautiful, anonymous design. What can we say? They are very handy: to clip papers together, keep food fresh, close your freezer bags, clip chips, hang laundry. Makes you wonder how you could have lived without a bag full of them! Everyone can use them. Comes in a pack of 10 clips.
