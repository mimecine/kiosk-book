The baby of our metal pitcher from Massachusetts included in America #1. The "large" was used for water, the "small" for caffeinated goodness - the right proportions for happiness. Technically a creamer, it is commonly used in Cuban circles for making coffee. Sugar first, coffee second, mouth third, stomach fourth, caffeine rush fifth, hopefully followed with a pastry sixth. If you don't drink coffee, you can use it as a creamer - it is allowed. Thank you.
