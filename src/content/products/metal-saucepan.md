Super minimal. I first noticed this pan in congee places. Floating in a vat of bubbling hot congee, it was used to scoop out servings. I can't say I would ever have a vat of congee that size in my house, but I can say I would use this pan for other things. It speaks for itself. Come October, glue two bottle caps to the bottom and your kids will spread robo-fear around the block when they use this as a mask. Stylish as a hat, practical too!
