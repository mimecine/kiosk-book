Found while we were in the South of France visiting family, these are just great for numbering an apartment door or a house or a sidewalk, and for lettering your mailbox or your car or your garage sale sign. The red-and-white packaging really takes the cake. Counting 1,2,3... A B Z... Ground control to Major Tom. Can you hear me? The numbers set includes nos. 0 to 9 and everything in between. The letters are all the Roman alphabet and there are 26. Used by Le Corbusier. You purchase the numbers and the letters separately.
