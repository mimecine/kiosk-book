Finland consumes coffee at possibly the highest rate in the world: it is said that the average Finn drinks 4 cups of coffee a day. (And I feel I am being a naughty with one espresso!). With all this coffee drinking going on, you can bet the coffee is good. I read that it was a Finnish law that coffee and alcohol could not be served at the same establishment. In that respect, I assume coffee drinking became an alternative to alcoholism, or hangovers, without coffee, became more fierce. This kettle is used to make Finnish coffee, or to boil water. To make Finnish coffee, boil the water and then add the coffee grounds to the kettle. Wait 4 or 5 minutes, letting the coffee sink to the bottom. Strong and good - just like the coffee - the kettle is made by OPA, established in 1926. This reliable pot has seen many incarnations over time. This size is perfect for apartment living. The larger the kettle, the more water you boil that in the end you never need. Holds 1.5 liters or 6 cups.
