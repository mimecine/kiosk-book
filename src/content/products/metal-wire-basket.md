I love this. It reminds me of what America was when agriculture was a national event, not a regional cry. Wastepaper basket, laundry bin, large umbrella stand, etc., etc. Or as they do in Mexico, if you have a juice bar it is the perfect container for oranges. Tipped on its side it holds them but allows you to reach in with ease.
