At the old Kiosk we had a line of Mexican masks on the wall. Until the very day I took them down, people never stopped asking me about them. It was pretty sad. Over and over again we had to say NFS: "Not for sale, my friend. Sorry." A famous artist wanted the wolf mask, and every other small child asked for the bird. Strangely enough, no one asked for the mouse. Anyway, the masks were never actually a part of the Mexican collection; they were hung for decorative effect in 2009 and there they remained until 2014, when we moved. Fast forward to June 1, July 1, August 1, and September 1 2014, months of phone calls, emails, and desperate Skype calls... Those masks really took over, and became something of a fixation for me. It was a problem. Four different individuals painstakingly compiled information to find these masks. While not identical to the originals, and definitely updated for today's more garish times - I swear to you, the originals are long gone, so please don't hold out any longer - they have got something special going on just the same. Look at those cuties.
