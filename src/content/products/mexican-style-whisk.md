The friends we were staying with in Mexico City swore by this. They told me: "Better than the French whisk and better than the Swedish whisk!". I feel all three are good for different reasons. The French whisk is great for blending, for whisking a number of different types and sizes of ingredients together. The Swedish whisk is good for medium-weight, smooth batters (cake, waffle, etc.), and the Mexican whisk is perfect for frothing hot milk or chocolate. I take a medium-sized glass or container, fill it halfway, and, rather than working in a circular motion, I churn the liquid with the whisk. It makes great foam!
