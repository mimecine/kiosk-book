Is it a planter or a bowl? That is the question; we can't figure it out, but my imagination tells me that a high-ranking military official felt each office worker in the service should have a planter on their desk and this "bowl" is the result. My logic tells me otherwise as this is a perfect bowl for hot soup - deep enough to avoid a spill while eating in the woods and easy enough to clean with limited water as the plastic is a bit water repellent. If anyone knows the answer as to where these came from, please let me know! PS: we know they are Swedish military as they have the triple crown insignia on the bottom.
