Another interesting kitchen device from Germany - the milk watcher! How many times have you had milk or pasta water quickly boil over on you? This ceramic disk sits on the base of the pan - as the liquid heats up, the increasingly larger bubbles raise the disk up and down causing it to rattle against the pan, grabbing your attention. The faster the boil, the more activity, and the louder the rattle.
