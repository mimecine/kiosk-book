You may think I am here to extract money from you but that is simply not true. I'm here to help and I have heard your stomachs cries. This is pretty good device if you like grilled food, if not, better to look elsewhere for satisfaction. The truth is this stove was not my first pick, my first love was another Japanese made compact-able stove produced by a reputable outdoor brand but it was always out of reach, just that much too much and yet I hoped, longed and I also searched. When I came across what's in front of you I quickly made a move. As far as small stoves go, quality is a rare thing, they generally only last a season at best. Not here. This object is smart and terribly handy. It not only pops up but it pops down (flat), in and out of it's own shamefully cheap bag. (I suggest you buy a more stylish computer type bag for the home it deserves.) It accommodates both found sticks or charcoal. The grill itself has an undulating surface for better cooking with small enough holes so nothing falls through, yeah remember all those scallions you had to pull out of the coals? Ash only adds so much to the flavor, don't be fooled. In our adventures we discovered (one variety at a time) it holds the following: 4 small lamb chops, 8 American standard hot dogs, 5 German sausages, 2 decent fish filets, 1 medium sized whole fish and 5 veggie skewers with marinated tofu. You can grill with this one. So grill, grill, grill and grill! Hey Mallmann, yeah, I'm looking at you.
