This pen looks like nothing but  
Actually,  
it is something.  
Look around you.  
Most inexpensive pens today have caps,  
but a cap is not practical.  
A click is far superior,  
like here.  
It says on it, in Japanese: "For Stock Market".  
With its razor-sharp point,  
perhaps some of the financial power of this pen, and Japan, will rub off.  
I am hoping.
