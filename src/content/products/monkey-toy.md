Discovered in the well-known Sonora market of Mexico City, known for its witchcraft market but it also has toys and party paper supplies. In all honesty, my husband found this for the collection. I think it is really strange and scary, but believe it or not kids love it (it must tap into some inner, primordial desire). Reminds us of some famous person who had a pet monkey. Please note each is different in many ways, just as we all are.
