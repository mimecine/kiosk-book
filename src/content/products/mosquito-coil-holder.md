Yes, this is beautiful and yes, this is expensive, but this is beauty and beauty can be expensive. But yet, beauty and expense do not always go hand and hand, in fact, quite the opposite is common, too. However, when it comes to this item, it possesses beauty, particularly for its purpose too, too. Function, it possesses function. Hanging from a nail and moving from place to place, the ash drops inside the circle, while the coil burns itself out; the smoke lifting to new heights, gently, too, too. Reality, it displays, as mosquitos are an increasing pest and although they are not beautiful, beauty can overpower them in the best of circumstances when combined with a coil that tells them to shoo, shoo. And so, that is my story about the mosquito and the coil and the holder, boo, boo. I can almost with 100% certainty say you will never see better, yoo-hoo!
