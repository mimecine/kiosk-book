This was One Of Those pain in the a\*\* products to get. Thank you, Mr. Marcus Gerold \[marcus.gerold@hosta-group.com\], for making it so complicated to show my customers your product. You see, as a wholesale customer, I could Either order a container - how many bars is that? 20,000?Â Or I could go to the Metro shop in the middle of the Berlin suburbs I Explained I did not have a car, Could not find my way - did not matter, then tough luck. Luckily, I was able to get out there. Why did I almost ruin my marriage over this? Because I like the taste and the graphics and after all, how can you resist? Who is not Attracted To Mr. Tom? Crunchy, gooey, peanutty mix, sexy maaaan ...
