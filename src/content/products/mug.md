A Swedish icon since 1978, perhaps the most common mug I have enjoyed coffee, tea, or warm soup from, whether outdoors or in any basic cafe. A Swede would not raise an eyebrow at these, although it could make their heart pound. The funny handle balances the cup perfectly between your pointy and birdie fingers, it looks awkward but it's strangely comfortable, restful one could say. The translucent variants are new for the season and I just renewed my vows to this graceful, wants to be glass, but is plastic, mug. Made by Nordiska Plast. Although I am not a huge fan of plastic I must admit it is sometimes needed and even better than a non-plastic equivalent. These mugs are produced from recycled material and colored with food safe dye. The factory has been modified with both energy conservation and the environment as a first priority. We won't get rid of plastic over night, that is a reality, and sometimes we need it, but we can buy from and support companies that are working to make it better. Nordiska Plast has it down.
