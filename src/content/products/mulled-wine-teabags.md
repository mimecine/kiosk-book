The ingredients for making mulled wine in a tea bag - how convenient. Mulled wine and really lovely packaging design, not bad! Use one bag for a bottle of wine, try two if you like more flavor. Clearly, don't use expensive wine, but also nothing that will give you a fierce hangover. Depending on how strong you like the flavor, let it brew for a shorter or longer period - keep testing and you may be tipsy in the end! Also good for making spiced red cabbage, hot cider and apple or pear compote - we love the graphic.
