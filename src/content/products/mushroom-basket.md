Romania, the land of mushroom stories...sure, it was the time of year we were there, but it's also something more. You go looking for trouble (mushrooms) and you are going to find it. We had so many mushroom experiences, it was impossible to count. There was the guide who was there to help us in our quest but then tried everything in his powers to foil us when he found we were actually good at collecting mushrooms and that Jason was an expert. There were the woods in the Apuseni mountains where we lost count of how many kinds we were finding, and I lost my sunglasses but somehow I knew they were in the chanterelle patch so Jason was able to find our way back and I was so amazed to find them I started crying. It was a mushroom miracle! Or the parasol mushrooms we found up the hill from where we were staying. Or the last and the best story about the Roma selling mushrooms and my wanting their basket and them not selling or making it, but saying they did, and then shouting with their friend across the street hitchhiking to Brasov to sell his porcini mushrooms and then him taking us to his father who was the real maker, and the children packing in the gate to his home, and our translator really not enjoying the entire thing, and us giving the porcini man a lift afterwards, with 5 of us in the car with the baskets, mushrooms and who knows what. The father made this basket and we paid him well for them. Unfortunately, as I would like one, and Jason too, we only have one to sell you.
