Dried tuna fished in the Azores and made by the Damaso family in Villa Real de St. Antonio. Please note, although similar in vibe to the well-known Italian Bottarga, Bottarga is fish roe; this is dried tuna fillets. We were introduced to Muxama, something I had never heard of before visiting the south of Portugal, by Tina, the owner of the lovely Companhia das Culturas in the little village of SÃ£o Bartolomeu. Tina is an anthropologist who has taken a real interest in the local cuisine of the Algarve. Muxama is the ancient technique of salting tuna and then drying it for several days. It has a strong but pleasant taste. Best sliced super thin and served with olive oil and fresh thyme. A very cold beer is nice too. Refrigerate after opening, store in olive oil if you like.
