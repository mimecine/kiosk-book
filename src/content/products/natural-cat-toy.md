Cats are crazy about this. In Japanese, it is called a Matatabi ball. Matatabi is a silver vine that grows in the Fukushima region of northwestern Japan. The inside of the toy is made from the bark of the plant. Sliced pieces of the tree make up the outer basket. Our cat enjoys it more than catnip. He likes how his nails get caught in the basket net. A nice change of pace for your cat - something new to enjoy! Poo Poo catnip.
