Good for the crying or tame baby. With disks that appear to come off but truly go nowhere, you can be certain to stump your child over and over again. Watch them spin the toy around and around for hours, and then wiggle the pieces back and forth for a few more. There is no great psychological mystery behind this rattle, beyond our innate human curiosity and our refusal to be dumbfounded at such a young age. Fairly quiet - a real bonus! Assembled by hand using natural glue. You know, with all the baby gifts I have to give, there are never enough options out there. This is the simple totem pole.
