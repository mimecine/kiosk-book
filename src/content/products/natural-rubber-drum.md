When Chris was in Colombia he sent me a picture of this drum and asked me to guess what it was. I thought it was a piece of a tree trunk and I had no idea what it was used for. A pen holder? I was surprised when he wrote me back that it is a drum made from strips of rubber sliced from the trunks of Amazonian rubber trees that are wrapped around tin coffee cans. The drum comes with a bamboo mallet and makes a sound similar to rain falling on a tarp. It's a pitter and a patter and a rat-tat-tat. I'd like to camp in the forest when I go to Colombia.
