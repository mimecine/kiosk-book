These toothpicks are made of corn, sweet potato and potato. They are a Korean invention, which was brought to Japan by a believer in the product. Regular wood takes 3-4 months to break down. These toothpicks take a matter of days. They have a nicer texture than regular toothpicks and do not splinter. They are a great stress reliever, have a good point and taste good once they start to dissolve.
