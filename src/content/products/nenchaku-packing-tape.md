The last time we were in Japan  
we went to visit our friends at  
Postalco - Mike and Yuri.  
Mike is one of these people who deeply considers everything.  
He is a person you can learn a lot from.  
He taught us the value of this tape  
and was surprised we did not know it.  
It rips and because it does  
you can tear it down  
into tiny, tiny pieces.  
But, note! It only rips in one direction,  
the width of the tape.  
If you try to tear it in the other direction,  
good luck.  
You bet it is strong too!
