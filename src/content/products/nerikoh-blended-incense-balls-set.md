This incense is uncommon in the United States, but in Japan it has been appreciated for hundreds of years. The tradition of burning incense is strong in Japan - much like the tea ceremony, it has an entire culture around it. It is said that one does not smell incense, but instead listens to it. Historically, burning incense has been a social activity and, over the centuries, there have been incense games developed where the "listeners" try to guess the scent being burned. The scents we offer are delicate and recognizable to anyone who has gone to Japan: sandalwood chips, which have a sweet and subtle smell, and nerikoh - blended incense balls - which are produced entirely by hand and made from ingredients that are blended into a base of honey and plum, and then aged for 3 years. The producer of this incense has been in business for 300 years - their recipes are a family secret. The effort of burning this incense is well rewarded as it is a unique experience altogether. Our set includes instructions and the ash and charcoal required to burn this type of incense. You need a cup with small feet or a slightly raised base to burn it.
