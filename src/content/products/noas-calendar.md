Noa Bembibre has been producing her calendar since 2007. The first year, it was released in the Finnish newspaper _Helsingin Sanomat_ as a monthly serial. A scenario that I think would make it hard to plan more than a month in advance. It is an interesting play on graphics and text. Quite lovely to look at every day, not a bad way to flip through time.
