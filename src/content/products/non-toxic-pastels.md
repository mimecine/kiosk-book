Twelve pieces of non-toxic hard pastels in a really sweet box. The circus really does make everything fun. I think the product speaks for itself. Anton Franz Mörtel founded his factory in 1870 and it remains a family business today. They began as a chalk factory outside of Nürnberg, but moved to Schwabach after WWII. Industrial crayons and other dynamic products were added in the 1960s. Pastels are the powdered pigment and a binder - the harder the pastel, the more binder. We also offer oil pastels and chalk by this firm.
