A general-purpose twine from Germany, commonly used by bricklayers and craftspeople. We think it is good for just about anything. General = everything. It reminds me of going to the bakery with my mom when I was a kid, where we bought boxes of lard-icing cupcakes that were really yummy - you know the kind that come in different colors, and you think they taste different, because they are different colors, but if you close your eyes, they taste exactly the same? Did you ever do the blue mashed potatoes taste test when you were a kid? How does one travel in thought from a very general German twine to a very specific blue food taste test? It’s amazing where objects can and cannot take you. We don’t have to sell you on this one. If you need twine, this is a really beautiful twine. Happiness should be in everything we do. Will hold up to 35 lbs.
