Oh dear, there goes another day. How many has it been, 112 or 114 or 115.22? I need to know precisely where I am in the world at all times, at any given moment. I don’t just count the second, I count the nanosecond. Let's talk about the tide and the moon, yep, I’m on that, too. Holidays as well, you name it, any denomination.You see, I’m an obsessive timekeeper. This one's big enough to cover the door to my house, one on the inside, one on the out, so I can be aware of every small detail when I am coming and going. Melodic memories of mystical, magic, merry memoirs by Jiyoni Kim.
