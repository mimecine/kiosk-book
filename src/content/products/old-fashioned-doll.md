What can I say about a baby doll besides it is cute, looks like it comes from the1950s, and resembles something I played with at my grandmother's. Where is her dress? Why do they only make a girl baby? Why don't they make toys like this any more? I was speaking to my friend and she brought up a really good point about this toy and the plastic plane and, actually, all of the toys from Portugal: they are NOT branded. No backstory, nothing comes with a name, no Disney or "Nick" character. The kids get a blank slate to call their own and apply their imagination to. Which is better: pretending you are in a TV in a video of "Toy Story," or building a tent and pretending you are in a tent in your bedroom with all the toys you named around you, and you invented their history to change at your whim? Aren't kids sick and tired of being told what everything is? I would be if I were one. Come to think of it,aren't we all tired of being told what everything is?
