Well, Oldenburg is Swedish born after all! The "N.Y.C. Pretzel" is an unlimited edition piece, stamped and signed, first released in November 1994. It is made of multiple layers of cardboard and is a three-dimensional object. Found in Sweden but produced here in New York...we thought it was a perfect blend of here and there; even though it is not made in Sweden we decided to break our own rule and include the piece! What the heck! It's art!
