Delicate device to shake olives off the tree. We tested it in a field while driving to Mycenae, and it works pretty OK. Although I'm skeptical in one way: things were not working exactly as they should. It could have been the season. It might have been the time of day, or the fact that Marco insisted on hanging upside down from the branch while I was giving it a dry run. Who knows what it really was? As Shakespeare says in the play Julius Caesar, "It's all Greek to me." We can't read anything in Greek, and the Greek words and names get spelled and translated in a huge variety of ways. Half of what I am spelling and telling you could be totally wrong. Well, for this object, let's assume it's an olive harvester and call it a day. Let me know how it works for you.
