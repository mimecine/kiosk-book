Traditional Portuguese object for olive oil in the shape of an oil can. As basic as you can imagine. The top pops on and off. If you don't own a funnel to fill this with,please buy ours. This is one of those objects that goes beyond words; if I need to explain "Why" then don't buy it. It's so beautiful I think I am going to cry, or wait, maybe that's coming from a lack of sleep.
