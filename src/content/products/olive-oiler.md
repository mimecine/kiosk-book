Olive oil, as you know, is in abundance in Italy and so delicious. And now, after some travels, I have determined the locals keep the good stuff for domestic use and the rest we, on the outside, get, don't forget the scandal some years back when it was discovered Spanish and Greek olive oil was mixed with Italian oil for export. The fact is, if you like olive oil, you have to go to Italy. Plain, simple and understood. There, _the liquid gold_ pours freely. The other fact is nearly every person has some olive trees they are connected to, which produce, naturally, only _the best oil_ in ITALIA! And what to pour _the best oil_ from? It deserves something good, not an old wine bottle. Rather, something like this model with a pointy spout and a flip-up lid. Something to delicately pour _the oil of the GODS_ (Roman gods of course), something of which only _the oil of ITALIA_ deserves.
