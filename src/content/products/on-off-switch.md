Ross, who designs Salvor, found this beauty while on vacation in the Yucatan. It was on our list of things to look for in Mexico. Walking through the electronic district of DF ("Distrito Federal" as Mexico City is known), we tracked it down PLUS 1,000 other electrical gadgets and paraphernalia, none of which we had any idea would work outside of the country. We don't know if this will work either, but we do know it's always ON. Why be OFF anyway? If you need a boost just flick the switch!
