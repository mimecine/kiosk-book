The night we spent in Djúpivogur, we were the only people in a hotel that held two hundred. I was excited about the restaurant, as we’d heard they serve local fish. Unfortunately for us, in March they only serve pizza. Huh? This was the third time in two days we had experienced a “pizza only” menu. After some casual conversation, I found out that pizza is what the locals like; it had only been in the area for five years! Our hosts were so kind they let us make a meal of Icelandic goods from the grocery store in the TV area of the hotel, which felt like sitting in grandma’s living room circa 1940. In this cozy living room we watched the results of the national referendum asking Icelanders if they would take on the Icesave debt. It was the first referendum since Iceland had become an independent nation in 1944. After our feast, we needed a drink. Here comes the Opal liquor… Opal in the black and white box is a sugar-free, extremely, extremely salty licorice, and quite tasty. See the Red Opal description for Part 2 of my story.
