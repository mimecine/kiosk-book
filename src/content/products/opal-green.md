A licorice flavored pastel in a bullseye box. I gave one to a friend the other day claiming it was not salty, and she spit it out! To her, it was loaded with salt. To me, it was almost sweet. It’s up to you. If you don’t like the taste, you have an inspiring box. The vegetable oil makes it nice and soft and chewy, but not sticky. Opal packages used to be a lot smaller, and they also had a light blue “flavor”. As the world gets smaller and the people get bigger (rounder), everything else grows too, I figure.
