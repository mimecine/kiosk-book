Are you ready for this? "Designed for rapid, high volume orange and Fuji apple harvesting." "Drop-forged steel alloy." "Resharpenable, fully heat-treated blades." "Specially designed to sever fruit cleanly from fruiting spur." "Custom-ground cutting edges and balanced spring design for fast precise action." Damn, these people don't mess around. The fruiting spur! That's hot shit! I don't harvest oranges, but I do find these to be nifty tools. Snip - oh my finger! Don't let me play with such pretty things! I don't have citrus trees, but I use this on my plants and on home projects all the time. They work great when a scissor does not do the job.
