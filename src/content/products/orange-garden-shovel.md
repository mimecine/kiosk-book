Found at a shrine in Kamakura.  
Where the grounds are meticulously cared for.  
Space is at a premium in Japan,  
so you donâ€™t have to guess why.  
Also, a shrine is a shrine.  
This plastic object will replace the bucket you carry around the garden.  
It is made to hold all the  
little or big debris.  
Can act as a shovel as well.  
The pattern is, of course,  
based on the original versions  
made of bamboo.  
As a gardener, I can say  
this is a good invention.
