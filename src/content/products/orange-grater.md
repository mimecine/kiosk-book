My friend Chris is a pretty good cook. When he went down to Colombia on an artists' residency he was excited to do his own work, to make a collection for KIOSK, but also to explore the local food. Now, Chris is not one for strictly dining out. When he got to the beautiful 19th century coffee plantation where he would be living for three months, he got down to setting up a home. That included the kitchen. I'm not sure how many of you have been on artist residencies, but the accommodations really vary. The kitchen where Chris stayed was nice - really nice - and really well set, except for one thing: a grater. So he set out looking for one, and this grater is the result of Chris' combing Medell√≠n to find the best local solution. I think we'd better visit that factory when I go to Colombia. Sharp enough for everything from lemon zest to cheese. Yes, I know it is plastic, but it works. And best yet - it does not rust!
