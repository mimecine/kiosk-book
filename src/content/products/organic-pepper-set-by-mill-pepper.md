I bet you didn't even know this type of stuff exists? Pure peppercorns that taste like the pepper they are, not the pepper they want to be. Taking it up a notch. The set includes the full range of Mill Pepper Co.'s Organic Kampot Pepper: Black, Red, White and Salted Cured Green Varieties. Certified Organic. Will Meeker, the dedicated founder, sent me some great details about his peppers, an abridged version follows: "The Green is too moist to grind in a pepper mill. The owners of the farm are Belgian and they love capers so they take the fresh harvest green peppercorns and cure them in a slushy sea salt brine and sun dry them as part of the final evaporation of the salt. It’s easy to chop, use-whole or rolled with a mortar and pestle. For the red, it’s quite flexible. Can be ground fine or course, nice on a salad. The bold tannins in the oil that you find in the black variety come from the unripened fruit, whereas in the red, the sugar has developed and the boldness is offset with a more subtle earthy sweetness. Delicious on soft scrambled eggs and pairs well with soy and sesame oil in a cucumber and herb salad. The white is the most delicate, it must be ground as fine as your grinder can go. Great in sauces and as a finish to fresh tomatoes, congee or sweets. The black is black. Just a bolder, better black that you can use less of without sacrificing flavor."
