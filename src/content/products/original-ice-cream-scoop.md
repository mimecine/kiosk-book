I still get excited when I recall the day my father brought home this exact ice cream scoop. It was amazing! A revelation! The super-duper-scooper contains a magic liquid that when shaken warms up the scooping part. It made for faster scooping! In our minds faster scooping meant more ice cream tossed into our bowl. We couldn't shovel the stuff in quick enough! Same amount of time scooping, with double the payload! Whoo Hoo! When we were researching our second American installment, I was really pleased to find the maker of our "wonder" scoop is based in Florida and still producing! They have been in business since 1935. It's nice to have a faster, better, work-it scoop.
