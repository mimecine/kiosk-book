When Chris was running errands one day outside of Medell√≠n, he stopped in at a small hardware store. He and Arles, the caretaker, were passing through Santa Elena to buy chicken-wire for the coop back home. While Arles was doing his thing with the wire, Chris decided to have a snoop around - you know, typical countryside meanderings, where you come up with the strangest things. I have not been to Colombia, but I assume this is the case there too. Oro looks like something everyone should have in their everything drawer, with its sleek gold labeling and graphics from a different era. Besides the good looks, it really does the trick on any metal surface. The box says: "Good to use on: Stoves, irons, bicycles, refrigerators, cars, motorcycles, silversmiths, cabinets, coolers, metal furniture. Multipurpose: use a heavy cloth moistened in water, apply Oro product on cloth, scrub the surface clean, and shine. Enhances and beautifies."
