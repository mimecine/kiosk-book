Generally, erasers are made of rubber, but prior to using rubber, white bread was used to erase pencil. In 1770 an English engineer, Edward Naime, created the first rubber eraser. Supposedly he picked up a piece of rubber on his desk instead of breadcrumbs and discovered the properties of rubber for erasing. However, while it worked well, rubber was not a stable material at that time, as it did not age well. It was not until 1839 when Charles Goodyear, of tire and blimp fame, invented vulcanized rubber that rubber erasers became common.
