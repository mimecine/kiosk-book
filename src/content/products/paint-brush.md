A brush typically used for Chinese Brush Painting. From what I understand, brush painting is similar to calligraphy. Nothing is pre-drawn; the artist goes with the flow and creates the piece in one moment. It is considered that the thoughts and knowledge of the artist are more readily tapped into when there is less preconception. I am not a painter so I have no direct reason to use this brush; it is one of those artifacts to add to the world archive we have going on over here. Do you have a huge archive of something?
