Mittens by the designer Pia Wallén. She is the type of person who considers and thinks about everything. Working in felt for 20 years, you can imagine she has grown to understand the material in ways most can only ever dream about. We were really excited when we found them. Have you ever traveled to bitter cold countries? Sweden is pretty far north; they know how to stay warm. These mittens are fitted to the wrist and travel high up the arm. They resemble oven mitts but we swear they are some of the most practical gloves for winter warmth and they are also look great oni. Touché.
