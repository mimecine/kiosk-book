Go back to the basics; throw down the Blackberry; throw down the computer - how many times have you lost your address book in the abyss of the machines? Pick up the notebook; pick up this address book and get back to the basics, the cherry red tabs will guide you. Have something for your numbers you can grow old with and care for, not some machine you are cursing half the day.
