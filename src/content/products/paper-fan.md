Since 1889,  
this company has been producing  
handmade paper fans.  
When they started, there were 15 other  
paper fan-makers in town.  
Today, they are the last.  
The paper folding fan was invented in Japan  
between the 6-8th centuries.  
However, you might notice,  
this fan can not fold.  
This type of fan is also common in Japan  
and is primarily used in hot weather.  
Good to keep nearby for humid days.
