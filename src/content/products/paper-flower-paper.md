We like this paper for the forms it creates, but its common purpose is to make paper flowers. The company which produces the paper started as a glue manufacturer in 1899, and continues to lead the Japanese market in glue production. When combined with their glue and a bit of handiwork, the paper can be used to create flowers in the same tradition practiced by nuns in France and Italy. These strips can be used for decoration, making flowers, marking pages, tying objects together, etc. Visual instructions are included.
