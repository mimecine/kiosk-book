When I found this hat it was similar to coming across an Oldenburg in a garage sale, except this was smaller than life rather than larger. It looks like a Basque hat or something Gauguin would have worn while working. Here you have the opportunity to have your very own little work of art. Hats off! Let's get down to business!
