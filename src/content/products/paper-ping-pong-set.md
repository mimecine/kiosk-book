Ping-pong is an important sport in China; do you know about Ping-Pong Diplomacy? It refers to the exchange of US and Chinese players in the 1970s, and it is largely considered that this exchange broke the ice and eventually led to Nixon's visit to Beijing in 1972. Much like the New York Philharmonic's recent visit to North Korea, the players' visit to China was a major milestone in the two countries' relations. It is interesting to note the American players entered China via Hong Kong; they actually walked from Hong Kong over a bridge onto the mainland. These are not real ping-pong paddles but paper ones produced for the Chinese funerary tradition of burning objects for the deceased to use in the afterlife. We all need to keep up with sport when we are dead!
