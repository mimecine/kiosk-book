Truth be told, we have worked with JP from Paper Pusher for over three years and I have never met him. I find this odd but I am trying to live with it. He’s waaaaay north in Canada and we are down here in New York you know. Ming, who has been a regular Kiosk person since 2007, went to school at McGill and she got to know JP. JP acquired a Risograph and he printed the Kiosk money for us, then he very kindly sent us his calendar. We immediately asked him for some at Kiosk, we knew you all would enjoy it too and you did. That was 2012. Moving on to 2013 things got even better and we got more ahead of the ball. We stocked the calendar for 2013 here but we were unable to keep one for ourselves! SOLD OUT. Moving onto 2014 we offer a calendar with phantasmic shapes, colors and kaleidoscopic froths on a daydream. Pass the days of 2014 in JP’s geometric fantasy. If anyone wants to give us a Risograph in 2014 I would be very pleased.
