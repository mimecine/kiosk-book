Kung fu slippers for the afterworld. Paper shoes for burning at a Chinese funeral, to be used on the other side. My fantasy was not to burn them but to match them with our paper hat and have some sort of strange installation with dancing shoes and a paper hat that constantly tips to say HELLO. I guess the slippers would be doing a tap or a shuffle, a bit odd for kung fu slippers, but in fantasy anything is possible. One more thing: I do think these are great with the hat for your new art collection. Oldenburg rocks after all.
