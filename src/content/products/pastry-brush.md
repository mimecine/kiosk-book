Being a pescatarian in Greece is an easy feat, as is being a vegetarian. There is always fish nearby and fava (a fava bean paste), horta (any type of bitter green in season), salad, and don't forget the delicious saganaki. In such respect, at lunch and dinner I was pretty much in dining heaven in Greece. Breakfast was another thing altogether. Did you know the Greeks don't really eat breakfast? You can find delicious coffee and a good-tasting bread, called koulouri, but other than that I was coming up empty. If bread is not your thing - and it's not mine - Greek breakfast can be a very dry affair. Remember, lunch happens late in Greece, around three or four; so for the first week I was skipping breakfast and not eating until the sun was on the bend in the afternoon. Then, faced with another week of daily hunger pains, I caught on and discovered I could find delicious, savory, spinach pie in all the good bakeries. This pie became my morning pal. Upon my return from paradise, I tried my baking hand at home. The many-layered filo pastries are all delicious, but to make them yourself, you need the right tools. A pastry brush is one of them.
