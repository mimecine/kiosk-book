This is a thing that our friends showed us with a wink. I thought, that's strange, you don't see that so often, a material exchange with a smile and a twinkle? What's this brown magic? Olive paste, not tapenade, which is less refined and I feel, totally different. Smooth like a nut butter and made with what I consider to be the finest and tiniest olives, the olives of Nice. Grown in a hillside village by Sylvain and his family and cured, pressed, pureed and jared on location. The trick is to use the pate in salad dressing, just a simple vinaigrette with a dash of this included, and on fish after it has been cooked. Perhaps especially if it has been baked with sliced, gentle onions and fresh thyme (not too much); given a spritz of fresh lemon when it comes out of the oven, with some fresh, chopped tomatoes tossed over and last, a few plops of the pate.  It works for me. There you go, you are on the Cote d'Azur. Be sure to open a cool bottle to go with it. Divine.
