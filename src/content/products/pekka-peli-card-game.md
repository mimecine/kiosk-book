Pekka-Peli is a game apart. Not only is it a game without winners - the goal of the game is to not become the loser, Pekka-Peli. The card game also depicts the non-losers as Finnish stereotypical families - the Baker, the Fisherman, the Banker, the Baker's wife, daughter and son et-cetera, et-cetera. Pekka-Peli, on the other hand - well, he comes from Africa and did I tell you that this was an old game? Anyway, as ethically incorrect as the game could be interpreted as, it still is a classic with beautiful illustrations. We suggest you substitute Pekka with a KIOSK wild card, we don't mind being the looser.
