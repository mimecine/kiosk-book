Nothing much to say here - great graphic design. The company that makes them could not understand why but I am sure you and I do; treat yourself to some inspiration and remember. Great, unadulterated graphic design like this will not be around for long so support it while you can and build up your own collection. Note the yellow on one side and dark green on the other...why? I don't know but I like it.
