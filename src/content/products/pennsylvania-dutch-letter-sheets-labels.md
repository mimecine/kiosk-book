Matt and Elaine Vardjan were both teachers when they started printing their papers with Pennsylvania Dutch motifs. Using a press the family bought in 1904, the cards are printed with hand-carved linoleum blocks (a separate block is used for each color), and with hand printedÂ precision. In the images you find a tulip, dahlia and distelfink. The distelfink is a strange and elusive bird. He perches, silent and hidden, amongst the ornate flowers, waiting for a lover or a juicy bug to fly by. Only when he finds what he is looking for will he soar through the Pennsylvanian fields singing his beautiful song.
