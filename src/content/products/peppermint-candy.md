Another product that has been made for 100+ years. All natural ingredients - I consider this a plus. Approximately 50 decent-sized tablets in pink and white. Their description reads: "Thanks to our fantastic fresh taste our product is especially good for smokers, sport people and speakers." I enjoy them here in the shop - fresh and tasty.
