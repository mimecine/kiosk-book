We were touring around and I was wondering, why all the peppers? All sorts of shapes and sizes, red, green and yellow. Little ones served at the start of the meal, medium-sized stuffed ones, pepper pur√©es. I was wondering - what's with all this pepper? - and then I realized: Hungarian paprika! Paprika! Pepper! I get it! These are from our friend's favorite vendor in the main food market in Bucharest. Hot and dried.
