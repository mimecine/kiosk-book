dimensions: 2.75"ø x 2.75"
dimensions_array:
  - 2.75"ø
  - 2.75"
materials: I want a glass of wine but I don't want to feel like a lush, just a
  splash...handy for when it is before noon. Also decent for water and morning
  juice. Cognac. Coffee. Sharing a small coconut water. You get the gist. Stacks
  for easy handling. It seems to me that this glass should be all over the
  United States but for an odd reason Duralex does not distribute it abroad.
  This may be one of those things that only the French can explain.
