Pewter is a metal alloy, generally between 85-99% tin, with the remainder being copper and antimony. In 1610, it made its first American appearance in Jamestown, Virginia, and at least five pewterers were active in the Massachusetts Bay Colony by 1640. While the very poor used wooden utensils, most colonists used pewter (although pewter vessels cost only about one-tenth the price of silver, they were still fairly expensive). However, not much early pewter exists today as during the Revolutionary War much of it was melted down to produce musket balls. The habit of giving newborn babies utensils and cups began in the 1800s hence the expression: "Born with a silver spoon in his/her mouth." Somehow, I find pewter more attractive than silver, as silver has become increasingly common. The form of this pewter cup is taken directly from a colonial original. The finish is called a "butler finish" - it falls somewhere between a shiny and spun look. A good surface to hide tiny fingerprints and damage that comes with cups being thrown. Made by a pewter maker on Cape Cod.
