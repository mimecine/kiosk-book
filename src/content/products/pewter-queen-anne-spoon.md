Pewter spoons made by a man in New Hampshire who obsessively collects antique molds. The small Queen Anne, made from a mold 300 years old, is a perfect spoon for children. I asked Jon if he had any forks or knives to complement the spoons, or anything larger. He reminded me that pewter is a soft material; therefore, historically it was never used for forks, knives, or serving spoons. He certainly is a purist and does not deviate!
