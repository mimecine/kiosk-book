Wood glue always comes in handy. That is, if you care about your wood things. I find a bottle like this, with a wide open top, more practical than something one squeezes. The reason being, to get really precise with glue, I feel it needs to be applied with a brush and a steady hand. Having an open top means you can carefully dip your brush into the glue. Pica-Pau means woodpecker in Portuguese. After the woodpecker comes and makes some holes in your house, or your cedar furniture you left outside, or your favorite tree, now you have the perfect glue to put it all back together again.
