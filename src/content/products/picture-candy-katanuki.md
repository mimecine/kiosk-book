What is “The Katanuki”?  
Something drew me to the box.  
It is very graphic and pretty  
with interesting images.  
Since 1952, Katanuki has been made  
and there is only one producer -  
so what is it?  
It’s a game for festivals,  
like the ring toss.  
Only you don’t throw something,  
you pick apart an image on its perforation marks with a tiny needle  
and if you are sensitive enough and careful enough, you end up with  
a whole image of something  
and if not, your Katanuki breaks into pieces.  
It’s about calm perfection.  
Marco succeeded with a whole Tokyo Tower  
on his first go.  
My apple turned to dust within 10 seconds.  
Fine craftsman I am not.  
Are you?  
Yuki tried her whole childhood with no success,  
sad...
