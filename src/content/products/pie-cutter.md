I first noticed a pie cutter like this at the Kutztown Pennsylvania Dutch Festival. That one was a different style, made in Taiwan and not the best quality. Still, the function of the object struck me, as I am really bad at cutting pies evenly. I knew I needed a pie cutter. My sister was set to the task of finding some "Made in the USA" options - pies are all-American, after all - she tracked this one down. Part-pie cutter and part-engine part, I think it is a beautiful thing - sharp, too. Ninja-like.
