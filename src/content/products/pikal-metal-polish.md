Stare intently into the pulsating red dot  
and listen.  
Stare intently into the red dot  
and do what it bids.  
The red dot asks you to polish -  
polish your metal,  
all of your metal.  
Go ahead and reach into your metal box  
and polish almost everything in there.  
Don't worry, this red dot won't bid you to do anything too strange.  
I don't know about the red dot on the sweet pick;  
that is a whole different story.
