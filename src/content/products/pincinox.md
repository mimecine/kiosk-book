Just how many pinches can one have? That's a random question that can be answered equally with the question, how many different kinds of chips can one eat? Pinches and chips are not globally the same. This pinch, the Pincinox, was invented in 1970 by Louis Violet was an engineer in Fos-sur-Mer, not far from Marseille. His son Alain worked in the same and every weekend they retreated to their factory to produce goods. One wonders how they could devote all their free time to a single clip but theirs was not a work, but instead a labor of love, filled with conviction, to do better and to be better. Bent from one piece of stainless steel the Pincinox can not break. It takes an incredible amount of persistence to alter it. It does not rust. It holds clothes on almost any line equally as well and it clips together a bag of anything you put in front of it. Once in place it does not pop off. An excellent tool with multiple applications. I have even used it to hold some pants up when I was without a belt. Comments did come. Pincinox remains a family business with the new generation in the process of taking over;  it is still manufactured and packaged by hand with the same solid belief that it is good for you and good for the planet too. A no waste / less haste kind of product, it will not deteriorate or break.
