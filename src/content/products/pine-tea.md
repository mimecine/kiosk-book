This was one of those really lovely scenarios and one of the reasons we both 1. Own KIOSK and 2. Talk about closing KIOSK. I actually found this pine tea years ago in Brussels, and rediscovered it last year in a storage box. I still thought it was beautiful: staying power! So I tracked down the maker and we called him. "Bonjour! Do you speak English?" -NO, click- Ok, ring ring, "Pardon, Msr., parlez-vous anglais?" -No- "Une autre personne?" -No, click- Donk! Marco! I need you to speak French to this man here! Marco spoke to him and is told, "The product is in every pharmacy in Belgium!" My reply: "C'est impossible!" And so on and so on, finally we got it here. It is an herbal tea, called Pine Tea, and it is good if you have a cold, cough, asthma, or respiratory illness.
