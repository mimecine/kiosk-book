Some regions are known for their nuts. Some people are just plain old nutty, for example: Newt, Rush, and Kiosk people. That means you \- yes, you. You're a nut and thank goodness for that! You fit right in. Right now, for instance, the fuse just blew in the hallway and I hear not only someone out there making ghost noises, but also something that distinctly sounds like theatrical thunder. Marco, meanwhile, continues to hammer together his display in the pitch dark. Yep, he's nuts, too. Just today, Honora and I were talking about how people are nuts and New York is nut central. I looked out the window and saw a real nut on the street and I thought, yep, I bet he is coming to Kiosk. Yep, he did, he came in and started shopping even though the lights were turned off, as we weren't yet open for the day. He was a super sweet guy, though. Yep, we like nuts, and we attract them too. Thank god, as we are nuts. Here is a nutty bar for you. Pistachio decadence: nuts for the nuts!
