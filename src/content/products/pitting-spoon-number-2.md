Yikes! This thing is sharp \- it will cut you up and pit a fruit in no time! Made for the agricultural industry out in sunny California, the blue handle is a requirement for the assembly line \- have you ever thought about it? Blue is the only non-food color, hence it is easy to find! I thought that was really cool.
