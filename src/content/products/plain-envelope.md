A friend called this a  
"Pee Chee All Season Portfolio."  
Paper is not dead.  
And since it is not dead, you need something made of paper  
to hold all the scraps.  
Perhaps something with a little metal clasp  
and expandability.  
Maybe you already keep all your paper organized and wrinkle-free.  
But I am betting that you just cram it all in  
only to empty it out  
when you are looking for  
a tiny receipt from the bike shop.  
Change is good.
