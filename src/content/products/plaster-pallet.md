This is a simple piece of wood that is quite fragrant and is used for plastering. I think it is so beautiful I decided not to use it for plastering but for household things. However, I do not suggest direct contact with food. A bunch of spices in little bowls on the pallet look quite nice, or use it for serving tea, or dry goods like cookies or crackers or candies. It is a very nice background or pallet, so to speak.
