That desk of yours. Your office mate. It's time to make good on the plan. Lend it all a Hand. Scissors in place, pens and pencils have got room, the paperclips need space, and better not forget the loose change, too. Rather than pooh-poohing your local congressperson's office, Lend a Hand! Offer to organize, to straighten, to sweep, to sort and shred. If you don't want to pay tax, it's time to own up to Ned. Pitch in and Lend a Hand. If they naysay you, just tell them "It's MY country," tell them "God damn you, you too. Lend a Hand!. Here's a broom." Restart public works today by doing what the public should do, dig us out of this economic war we have been through! Stop asking the 1% for explanations and start doing - as I said, no more pooh-poohing.
