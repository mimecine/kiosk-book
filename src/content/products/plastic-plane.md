Plastic, colorful, pretty, non-branded, uncomplicated, a plane. No questions like: What is that logo, Mommy? Who is Delta, Daddy? Talk about more important things,like how ice cream is made. Stick with the fun. Now that the airlines have cut down on all the perks, you better bring one of these on your next plane trip with little Tommy. No more free coloring books, captain's wings, or planes for the kids. BYOP along with the BYOB and BYOF, hopefully not BYOTP, although I would not put it past Ryan Air.
