A recycled bag made from leftover rice, grain, and bean sacks. If you compare it to the straw moral you can see direct parallels in terms of the pattern, I found that interesting. A moral is used by men, commonly taken into the fields for the day with a machete. It is sturdy and holds quite a good amount. We found this in the same region as the straw moral. It is always great to find a product that finds yet another solution for recycling material.
