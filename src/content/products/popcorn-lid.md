Put a lid on it. Pop pop pop. One lid fits all pots, and as an added bonus, there is a little container under the lid to hold butter. The heat from the pan melts the butter, and the kernels popping hit the lid, which in turn causes the butter to spray down over your hot kernels. Nine out of ten apartments in New York have a microwave; two of those apartments actually have a kitchen you can cook in as well. Is it something about microwave popcorn? What is it?! I call it "nukecorn"! Blah. Gershon Kingsley recorded the original "Popcorn" song in 1969. He claimed he wrote the primary melody in about 30 seconds, less time than it takes to nuke a bag. The band "Hot Butter" made the song famous in 1972. The song was first released in 1969 as part of a Kingsley solo album called "Music To Moog By."
