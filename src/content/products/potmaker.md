It's time to take over our roofs. All the empty lots are going, going, or gone. Place a plant in the front yard, on your stoop, in the garbage area, at the entrance, in your window, and just near your bathtub. Seeds are cheap! One potmaker can churn out an infinite number of seedling-size newspaper pots for your plantlings. Get some dirt, a little bit of compost from your local farmers, order some seeds, find an old newspaper, and there you go. Plant the seeds and watch them grow and grow. Lend a Hand to your eyes and your nose; with the potmaker, make plants for wherever you go. Presented to us by a nice customer.
