Chan Pui Mui- eaten as a snack, Chinese preserved plums are very different from Umeboshi, the Japanese varient of the same. They are a pickled plum, a bit tart but mostly just an undefinable taste.You either like them or hate them, but should try them at least once. It's kind of good to give to friends with whom you are not so friendly because if they hate them, they will really hate them! We sell two variants: the difference is one has orange and the other does not; this one does.
