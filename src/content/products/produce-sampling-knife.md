"Danger!" speaks the voice from within this knife. Grapefruits, oranges...beware. Beauty also cries from within. The cream handle makes it a delicate dagger. The blade being so long as it has to pass entirely through a grapefruit - grapefruit, you say? On guard! Suddenly, the mystery from within the knife seems far less dangerous. I like grapefruit. Whitney's grandfather had a fruit stand in Florida and carried one of these around in his pocket.
