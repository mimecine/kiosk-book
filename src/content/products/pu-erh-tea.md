Labeled by some as the "miracle tea" and as having anti-aging properties, Pu-erh or Bo Lei tea is scientifically documented as lowering cholesterol and, in that respect, is often recommended after a heavy meal. I was totally unaware that it was such a "loaded" tea. So many issues... even the classification of the tea is dual: there are both raw/green (sheng) and ripened/cooked (shou) forms. The tea originally comes from Yunnan, China, and is a long-leaf tea; therefore it is often packed and sold in cakes, bricks, and other forms. This means it can be easily stored and transported. There is a huge market in aged Pu-erh, similar to the vintage wine market. Cakes of 50-plus years old can be found, and go for $1,000 and up. Although I was intrigued with such an expensive cup of tea, I realized I could own the best tea but I would likely brew it wrong. Instead, we wound up getting a very good quality Pu-erh in a non-cake form so it is easy to use. Between spending my time learning about the tea - it goes on and on - and practicing brewing, I try to do the bookkeeping for KIOSK. The tea should be rinsed twice and is considered the only tea you can store for a long period of time.
