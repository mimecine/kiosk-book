Nice graphics, again - I feel like I am in the true Candyland. The contents are even better: little coffee beans with a mocha taste and each Puss & Boots has a forest animal imprinted on it - the hedgehog, owl, rabbit, cat, etc. - all of the animals Puss presented to his master in the tale. Not fancy chocolate, but some of the sweetest-looking around, both inside and out! Tiny enough pieces so you can eat a bunch of them and not feel a moment of guilt!
