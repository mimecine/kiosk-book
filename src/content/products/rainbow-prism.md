There is one beauty and it is in the rainbow. Lend your eye a hand. Carry the prism in your pocket and be the guy with the rainbow, that girl with the planet. Lend a Hand to all those down in the dumps and dark in the soul. Mother Nature can be so generous. Father Earth can be so kind. Lend us all a Hand to see the beauty that surrounds us around and around and around and around... Snap out of it! Lend a Hand!
