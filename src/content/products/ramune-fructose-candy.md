Everyone likes sugar and  
pretty wrappers.  
Ramune is a very classic candy in Japan.  
Today it is only sold in classic candy shops.  
This candy is made of fructose  
or fruit sugar.  
Some people consider it to be  
a step better than refined sugar.  
I like the way it dissolves on my tongue.  
Also, I like the flavor.  
If I need a pick-me-up,  
one in a glass of water does the job.  
In Japan, there is a Ramune drink.  
My idea has been bottled!
