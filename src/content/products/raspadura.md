Raspadura is a raw sugar without refining, with a high molasses content. In Spanish, raspar means "to grate" and dura means "hard". Raspadura can be substituted when a recipe calls for dark brown sugar. I was advised it is used in cooking, for sweetening coffee, and also that people suck on it. What a pacifier! I grate some over whipped cream and berries. Marco likes to chop pieces off and snack on them. It is found all over South, Latin and Central America, as well as in Mexico, and Cuba. Ours comes from a family bakery in Miami. The grandmother always answers the phone and speaks no English; I always talk to the grandson. It's a mini-monument.
