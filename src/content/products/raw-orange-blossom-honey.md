Are you familiar with the Orange Blossom Express? It was a train inaugurated in 1925 between Miami and New York City. It was real fancy and inspired the most famous fiddler's song of the twentieth century, "The Orange Blossom Express", by Ervin T. Rouse and Robert Russell "Chubby" Wise - perhaps you know Johnny Cash's version, released in 1965? Time and time again, I have come across numerous ties between Florida and New York State. Whether it is people migrating between the two or starting a company in the North and then taking it South, or the beginnings of the Florida citrus industry, with growers hauling crates and boxcars of citrus direct to New York City, it's almost as if the two states have always had a direct link between each other. I think that's why I was so taken with this honey - besides the fact that it tastes real good, it sums up the two states' relationship. Mohawk Trading, based in upstate New York, transports their bees all the way from Maine - wild blueberry honey - down to Florida for orange blossom honey. It's a funny business, driving bees around the East Coast to pollinate and gathering the honey they produce in the different locations. Like a fine wine, you can really taste the difference between the different crops yields. New York and Florida - I never knew there was such a nice connection between the two.
