Am I the only one who buys Ikea in this room? Am I also the only one who resorts to banging it really hard to put it back together on a seasonal basis? How about all those other things around the house that can use a little banging: DVD player... window... radio... leaky faucet... husband. Just think of all the endless household repairs that could be done in an afternoon! Made by Garland Manufacturing Company, founded in 1866, the only producer of rawhide mallets in the USA. I found this in my father's tool collection, the best of the best.
