Akabeko is a traditional toy  
from the Aizu region of Japan.  
Made of papier-mâché  
that is painted and lacquered.  
When I was growing up  
I had a mobile  
with a little  
Akabeko on it.  
I never forgot him.  
He is thought to ward off sickness.  
Akabeko are made by fewer  
than a dozen family-run workshops,  
and the technique has been passed on  
for generations.  
It looks simple,  
but the process of making one  
takes about 10 days.  
His head moves. I find it mesmerizing.
