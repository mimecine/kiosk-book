Another great Kwikshop product. Made in a small metal workshop operating since the 1930s. Holds approximately 5 liters, which is perfect for recycling plastic shopping bags. Works for a single-person home, a couple or an office. The color is really stunning, but it was the round rubber pedal that completely sold me on it. The inner bin lifts out entirely.
