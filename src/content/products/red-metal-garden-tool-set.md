Summertime means garden hand tools with the right weight. The holes in the handle combined with the cool iron feel great on your garden-work-sore hands. The red color prevents you from losing sight of them, unless they are dropped among your dear red poppies. My sister said no real gardener would use these because the handles are not cushioned. Well, I think of myself as a real gardener, even though I am city-folk, and I use them! She's a softy! Good in the sandbox too! The tools are made by a small factory in central Sweden that still runs on local production and entrepreneurship. They have been manufacturing the design since they opened in 1976 and have produced over 4 million pieces since then! Not bad...
