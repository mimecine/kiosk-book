In Cuetzalan most of the indigenous women of a certain age wear this necklace. It comes in a variety of forms, from long singular strands to a group of shorter strands like this one. With their very white traditional dress you can imagine it stands out. The textile researcher, Bob Freund, told me the beads represent coral, as historically it was traded with the Indians from Vera Cruz over the mountains. When worn as a group, the beads are always finished with a number of colorful ribbons that match the ribbons braided into the wearer’s hair. These ribbons often go far down the woman’s back to touch her waist finishing in a bow or a knot.
