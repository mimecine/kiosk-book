Made by a firm established in 1907, we visited their factory in the countryside; it was a small place adjacent to their home. The mother of the house and co-owner of the business showed us around - the top floor was packing and warehousing; the bottom floor was where the goods were made. We saw the oven the chalk was baked in and the molds, as well as the rooms where the watercolors were processed - one color at a time - with the room shifting color based on whichever is being produced. It was a pretty exciting operation, totally down-to-earth and very basic, not at all what one imagines when you have their product in your hand. I was thinking assembly line, teams of people, industrial environment, etc, etc. It is very different from the New Jersey Turnpike industrial view. Each chalk has a paper sleeve.
