We brought these in on a whim as I either always need a step or a seat close to the ground. They stack which means they are handy as a spare seat around the coffee table during a late night drinking game, added bonus is you don't have far to fall. This was an import that made no financial sense but I needed some for myself. I only indulge once, so, this is it. The hard, shiny, plastic is the same as our red lampshade, therefore, if you have one of those, you have a nice little set.
