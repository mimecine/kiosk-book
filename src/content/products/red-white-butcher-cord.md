I remember red and white colored twine from bakeries, but in Germany, it is associated with butchers and apparently most people also use it at home. It is taste-free for cooking, heat resistant and comes in a self-cutting container. Ross: "Good for making popcorn necklaces." Theo: "Pretty much the coolest twine you can buy." A little bit pricey, but ours lasted for almost 2 years. The holder is very practical too. Essentially, this twine is the only twine you need to have around.
