Don't let lighting a candle  
go the way of writing letters.  
I mean, really,  
when is the last time you wrote a letter?  
Go ahead, light 4 candles, sit down  
and write some letters,  
maybe even just a postcard.  
Don't stare into the flame for too long,  
it mesmerizes  
but  
let the flickering candlelight  
push your hand along.  
All candles should have colored wicks.  
That is a really nice touch.  
Colored wick candles for sale.
