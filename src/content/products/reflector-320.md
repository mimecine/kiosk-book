Wanting to cover a decent part of New England, we did a lot of driving, as one would figure. We passed many driveways and drove down a lot of roads. Over time, I saw something that kept repeating itself \- particularly in the state of Massachusetts \- reflectors. Nailed to trees, birdhouses, posts, marking driveways and dog houses, trailers and garbage cans - the state has a thing for them, beyond marking the road in case of high snow...you name it. Emergency & reflective marking was popular. I first saw this reflector attached to a chain, blocking a driveway, and now I use it to signal my friend across the street when it is time to go for our morning jog. One flash = coffee first; two flashes = it is too early; three flashes = I'm in bed. It's great to reflect \- simply futuristic.
