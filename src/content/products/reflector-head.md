Mount this onto the back of your bicycle fender for reflective protection; the metal pieces wrap around the fender and get screwed on. Just like the decorated trucks in Mexico. Jazz it up! Or maybe place on the bathroom door at night for easy locating while under the influence. Either way, enjoy! (Please note each is different so the colors vary, but we hand-picked all of them and all are nice!)
