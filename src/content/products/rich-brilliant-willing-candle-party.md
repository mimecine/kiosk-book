Star light star bright, how I wonder how I might...rather than bringing flowers bring a bunch of candles. Hand-crafted in the Yankee style and bringing back all the fun memories of every birthday you ever had when you were a kid. A real steal. The first KIOSK commission, produced by RBW until they get tired of making them, consider this a fairly limited run. Each one is different. Created as part of Mini-Exhibition #1.
