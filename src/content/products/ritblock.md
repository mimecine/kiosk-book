A relative to the Skissblock “the Rit” is the one for drawings that mean more, things that take time, love that is not just an encounter. With such importance and high standard the paper is recycled, naturally. Made by a man outside of Stockholm who produces it from the scrap of large printing jobs. Why he does this work I do not know. For moral reasons, for the sake of art? Made for an undetermined length of time, we have found one dated to the 70s in Marco’s fathers studio. God like connection.
