Living between two worlds, cm on one side, inches on the other. Walk with measurements in the pocket. A wheel and retraction at a touch of a button, no more slow folding of the measuring tape. An item which has been copied, this is the original.Â Produced by a German company established in 1895. I found the red in the drawer of my flat, the yellow at A+F's home, then the yellow again at Gordon Robichaux and lastly the yellow, in my storage. This item was calling me: come out, come out wherever you are.
