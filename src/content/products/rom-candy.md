It is a fact: all the chocolate in Romania is slightly boozy and I love it. I'm the one who loves little, liquor-filled chocolates. In Romania, it's slightly different as the booze is blended in - a drunkard's surprise! ROM used to stand for Romania, but some years ago the country changed it to ROU. ROM means "gypsy" in Romanian, but it also means "rum". As ROM is considered by many to be the national chocolate bar (like our Hershey bar - note the ROM packaging which is the Romanian flag in reverse) you have quite a complicated situation there. A national bar with the flag in reverse and the old abbreviation for the country with a boozy taste. Sounds like our trip!
