I was fairly surprised how few indoor \- or should I say how many outdoor? - toilets there are in the Romanian countryside. Practically every house seems to have an accompanying outhouse. Old traditions die hard. This is the good, solid, metal bucket you would find hanging over the family well. Can also be used to store sawdust in the family outhouse.
