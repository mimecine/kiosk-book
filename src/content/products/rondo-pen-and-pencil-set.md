The RONDO pen was first launched in 1993. It is a typical office pen for everyday use with high reliability and comfort. Sadly, the RONDO has been recently redesigned, but we were lucky enough to get some of the old models from the very nice owner of the company. The maker Ballograf, founded in 1947, is the only manufacturer of writing instruments in Scandinavia. All of their products have a lifetime guarantee; they will repair or replace any product with a technical problem. Although we have not tested it, the company claims each pen offers 8,000 meters of writing without smearing. Other details: archive proof ink, a stainless steel point and a wolfram carbide ball. On top of ALL that, it is my husband’s favorite pen! The pencil works great too. Refillable, comes with Blue Ink & Lead
