For certain the most beautiful hand brush you will ever find. So, if you are really, really neurotic or into brushes like I am \- after all, how many have we featured during the past four years at Kiosk? \- then this one is for you. If you can obsess over the appearance of your winter mittens, shouldn't you care about the message your cleaning brush sends? You have to be careful, appearances can be deceiving, for better and for worse!
