A Portuguese broom to use outdoors or on rough interior areas. Why the round shape? No one knew! The odd thing is there is an identical toilet-sized brush. Marco insisted we buy the toilet brush to give for free as a mini-me match when you buy a big broom. So, every broom comes with a matching toilet brush! Talk about designer coordinates! You've got it!
