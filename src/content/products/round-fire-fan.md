Fan your love's fire or just your own face. Earth, Wind & Fire used these as props during their 1982 tour of Portugal. They gave them out to the audience and asked everyone to fan along to the lyrics. It was a hot summer day before the stadium wasair-conditioned. The manufacturer has since had a big success with this product every summer. Cool, no pun intended.
