Let's be honest, you love being underwater, looking at the fish or your cousin's legs or a frog or a leaf floating high above on the surface, but you don't want to come back to the surface with some garish day-glo, clear plastic abomination sucking on your face. You want to look like you spend summers on a boat, telling stories of dolphins, the albatross' long journey across the seas and sea urchins as big as a van. You want to look like Jacques Cousteau at 32, without all that gear. This mask will help. Inspired by the Weeki Wachee mermaids at Weeki Wachee Springs, Florida.
