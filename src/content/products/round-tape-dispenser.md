Okay, believe it or not, this was one we actually went to Sweden and tracked down; we knew about it and wanted it for the shop. You know, we actually do have quite a few boxes to seal up and we all know the famous American tape "guns" misfire constantly and work like doo-doo. Swedish-made, who knows where, we could not find the manufacturer, there was not even a bar code on the box... true anonymous design at its best! It is powder coated and comes in a Swedish blue. If anyone knows the maker, please let us know, we'd like to have a chat with them.
