A plain, basic rubber bucket made for all sorts of farm chores or to clean with. As I am told, horses tend to walk on things - strange, because I know they refuse to step on a human - but apparently, they have stepped on many a bucket and rubber does not break. Those silly billies. Also used in construction, particularly for plaster mixing. When I tried it at home I liked the weight - no worries about it tipping over. Also, the metal bucket I have has made marks on my wood floor. Do you know Florida is ranked third in the U.S. for the number of horses in the state, just behind Texas and California? I had no idea they even had a horse country down there, but they do and also a rodeo scene, near Ocala. There is even a breed called the "Florida Cracker Horse," which in the early 1900s roamed the state. Do you think Montana will some day be as built-out as Florida? It's odd to think of ranges and horse and cattle in Florida, I know, but up until the 30s there was a lot more open land down there. I drew some sort of a parallel between the Camargue in France and Florida once I heard this - every place has its own cowboy and frontier; Florida is often called the "Last Frontier."
