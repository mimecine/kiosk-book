After you're finished prying with the crowbar we offer, you might need or want to smack (but not smash) whatever it is you've pried (hopefully with success) back to its original position. It's also great for assembling all those do-it-yourself IKEA items. Perfect gift for the person who has everything AND a crowbar (because they probably don't have this). But if they do, you can always get them the toolbox we also offer.
