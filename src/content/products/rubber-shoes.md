The traditional Romanian shoe, originally in leather, the maker claims to have started making them in rubber 50 years ago. Now as cars have no inner tubes in their tires he has to resort to used inner tubes from tractors - so his material is scarce. Lace them up the leg, typically worn with a swatch of fabric wrapped around the foot like a sock.
