Inches on one side, cm on the other. We live in a global economy - it's not that hard: a meter is roughly a yard, a decimeter is like a tenth of a yard, a centimeter is like a tenth of a tenth of a yard, and a millimeter? Yep, like a tenth of a tenth of a tenth of that yard. Peasy-easy! Made by hand in the Netherlands, and truthfully, how many things still are? The stick fits in your back pocket, and the brass looks like gold. Handy conversions appear on the side too. It's the holy grail of measuring sticks.
