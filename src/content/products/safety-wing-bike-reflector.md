Fly away, O Safety Wing! The wing, invented in 1976, is a reflector that sits on the side of your bicycle and swings in and out on demand. We thought it was perfect in New York City to give taxi's a "Stand-back, keep-your-distance, watch-my-wing!" message (not to mention how it will confuse them, as likely they have never seen anything like it). Comes with all the necessary hardware and is REALLY, REALLY easy to install. Trust us, we know, I like simple DIY.
