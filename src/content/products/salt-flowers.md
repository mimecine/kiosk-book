I was aware of fleur de sel but I was not familiar with flor de sal before I went to the Algarve, a region of Portugal. Both are a slightly moist salt. Because the crystals are quite small is dissolves faster than regular salt. Skimmed off the surface of the salt pans, the incredibly delicate process yields an even more delicate product that is easy to break in the fingers or to toss directly into a salad, etc. I hate using rock salt for the reason it is so hard to break up! Ouch!
