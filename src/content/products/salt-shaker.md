You like salt? Consumption is going up and up. I like salty granola. I like salty fries. I like raw herring. It was an eater's delight for me in the Netherlands. Unless you have a salt fixation, or a chip shop, you may not need this salt shaker. However, if you use confectioner's sugar, you will find this shaker comes in handy. In addition, if you have an interest in good industrial objects, you may want to add this to your collection. Likewise, if you need something to water your dandelions (or perhaps, to give your hamster a shower), this object is for you. Sometimes you don't need to know exactly what you are going to do with something when you buy it. For example, do you think Beyoncé knows what she is going to wear with every pair of diamond bangles she buys? The more tennis bracelets, the better. One day they will all come in handy, like this salt shaker. Please don't cry.
