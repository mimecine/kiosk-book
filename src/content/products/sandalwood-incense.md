Stick incense or Joss sticks are associated with religion in China. Traditionally used as an offering to Buddha, they are commonly burned in Chinese temples, during funerals, at shrines, and so on, but now are also used to perfume a room. The smell is fairly common and once you get used to its presence it is easy to miss. Sandalwood is believed to keep you alert during meditation; it was commonly used in medicine until the 1920s and '30s as an essential oil. The name "Hong Kong" translates to "Fragrant Harbor." According to some historians, the name derived from the large number of incense trees grown in and exported from Hong Kong. This incense is from one of the more established firms in Hong Kong. We sniffed a lot of incense during our stay, as I have a picky nose. Since we came back from Hong Kong I light a small stick every day when we open the shop, burning one a day to "clear" the air. It is a nice habit.
