To Finns, the sauna is a necessity, not a luxury. Before there was widespread healthcare, mother's gave birth in the sauna; it was the first structure built by a family as it provided living, storage, bathing, warming, as well as sterile conditions. Sauna is the most appropriated Finnish word. An ancient word, it describes the Finnish bath as well as the bathhouse proper. Having a firewood sauna by a lake at night in the middle of the summer is a magical experience. Because of it playing such an important role in Finnish culture, I knew we must include sauna items in the collection. After looking at no less than 15 different buckets, this was the most beautiful one we found.
