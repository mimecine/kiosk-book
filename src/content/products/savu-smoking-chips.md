Chips to go with the smoker. With so many people fishing and so many fish being caught and smoked in Finland, one can imagine there is a heck of a lot of smoking chips on the market. Savu comes recommended by a regular smoker. We first saw them in the main Helsinki indoor market: a touristic place, but one with a decent amount of delicious things. Even if this variant is touristic, it has a great reputation and really, how touristic can wood chips be? For that matter, how can there be so many different chips? Wood is wood. But each type of wood has its own flavor and the thickness of the chip relates to how quickly it burns and smokes, so the type of chip does make a difference after all. Take your chips seriously, smokers!
