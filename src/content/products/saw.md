Three-quarters of Finland is made up of forest and woodlands. That's a lot of wood to cut. The total volume of stock in Finnish forests amounts to nearly 2 billion cubic meters. This amount of timber would make a 10 meter-wide and 5 meter-high wall around the globe. That's a lot of wood to cut. The forest industry accounts for 13.1% of Finland's economy. That's a lot of wood to cut. Due to illegal lumber logging across Russian / Finnish borders, Greenpeace awarded Finland the Golden Chainsaw Award in 2006, reserved for the worst forest crime offenders. That's a lot of wood that should not be cut. Think, Finland, think.
