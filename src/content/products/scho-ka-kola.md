Scho-Ka-Kola - energy chocolate - is the chocolate equivalent to Red Bull. On the road, driving the Autobahn we, of course, ran out of steam - the trip was long. (Side note: I felt horrible we were polluting and not taking the train, but when one wants to get into the nooks and crannies of a place, your own transport is needed.) As you can imagine, 12 days of road madness - "the German border patrol" as we called it - equals a need for a caffeine boost. I am not wild about coffee, but the green tea was not cutting it past day 5. I have to be honest, I was drawn to the metal tin of the Scho-Ka-Kola - it was when a nice truck driver explained to me - in very minimal terms, as we did not share a common language - the energy-boosting properties of the snack: a combination of dark chocolate with 58% cocoa, natural caffeine and cola nut extract. Packed in a handy round metal tin with 16 portions in triangular chunks of caffeinated madness. Not Timothy Leary-grade, but as far as legal substances go, it does some sort of a trick. Although I am not driving while in the shop, I keep one at my desk, likely I should be eating some now. Zzzzzzzzzzz.
