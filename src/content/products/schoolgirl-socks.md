Very cozy, long enough to come to the knee or even cover the knee if you are petite! These socks are a standard part of each girl's school uniform. We stayed with a friend in Mexico City (see dfcasa.com) and their friend came by and freaked out over my choosing these. You know, one of those nostalgia things, a validation of sorts. I thought the sticker was a great piece of graphic design as well.
