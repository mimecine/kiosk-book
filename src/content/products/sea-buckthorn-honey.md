Honey made by Mia and Bjarne Bruce. They started beekeeping in 1982 with 2-3 beehives and now have about 100. They told us stories of neighbors calling them to report a swarm of bees and Bjarne going and catching the swarm to create a new colony. It happened three times this summer. This is one of the ways their collection of hives have grown. In addition to beekeeping, they grow wheat, rapeseed, rye and oats. After producing honey for so many years, they began experimenting with flavored honeys. It was by chance a neighbor friend of theirs had Tyrni juice from her local crop so they decided to try blending it into their honey. Tyrni, or "sea buckthorn juice," is electric orange, almost radioactive-looking. Sea buckthorn is nicknamed a "super-fruit" as it is loaded with vitamins and minerals. Harvesting is difficult, due to the berries growing on thorny shrubs and a shrub can only be harvested every 2 years. Throughout Asia, the berry has historically been used to treat a huge variety of illnesses from cancer to rheumatism. Super-honey.
