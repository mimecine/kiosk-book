As a kid, I had to resort to stripping the rubber off Lego wheels to build imaginary lifts from the attic of my house to the tree on the other side of the street. The vessels, more often than not, were destroyed upon impact at the landing site - mostly a cherished event between me and my friends who sometimes filled the them with firecrackers and petrol just for the effect. This toy is the starter-kit from a series of well-made wooden toys, all dealing with the fascination of line-powered vehicles. Made by Kraul, all their toys have very good intent - educational, mind-bending, thought-provoking and world-problem-solving type intent. If you want to push your kids into the line of engineering, placing this in their hands is a great start. Firecrackers and petrol are as good as the closest stuffed animal, albeit slightly riskier.
