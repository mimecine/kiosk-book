Alright, one thing you have to remember is Germany is an egg country, who knew?! The Swedes are known for dairy, the Italians for pasta, the French for sauces, the Americans for doughnuts, etc., etc., but the Germans for eggs? Whatever...I digress...the point here is that the Seprafix, while it looks like an innocent juicer, is much more. Consisting of three layers: you have the outer layer for oranges - lift off - the second layer is an amazing yellow I have yet to see elsewhere, for lemons and limes - lift off - and the third layer is for separating eggs. Crack the egg over it and the yolk is held in the top while the white falls into the basin. "Be a master chef or just look like one." I'd love to see a late night ad for the Seprafix.
