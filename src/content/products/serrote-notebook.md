Serrote, an excellent Portuguese graphic design team, produces a variety of printed matter on the letterpress. This notebook has been printed and reprinted a total offour times; it is their most popular book. I have to copy what Serrote says about all of their editions, as I can't write better. We love their work; in fact, almost two years ago we included their money notebook in our "8 things" collection. It was our very first Portuguese item! Later, Serrote and Viarco will come together for Kiosk... "This is the fifth notebook made by Serrote. With cover printed in letterpress and the inside filled with tablecloth paper, this notebook was conceived for those who love to scribble on restaurant tablecloths. This is the tenth notebook made by Serrote. It was time to print a new tablecloth notebook, after the first one (our best-seller) sold out. It is filled with the same paper, in a different cover printed in letterpress. A new chance to bring with you the base of the Portuguese food and drink. This is the fourteenth notebook made by Serrote. When your appetite grows but the food doesn't arrive, you can always scribble on your tablecloth. The notebook cover was printed in letterpress using ornamental borders. The paper of the inside hungers for pints and codfish cookies. This is the nineteenth notebook made by Serrote. If the Portuguese waiter doesn't understand your mother tongue, just draw your favorite fish on the tablecloth. The cover was printed in letterpress and the inside is filled with tablecloth paper."
