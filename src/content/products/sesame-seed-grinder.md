Ok, I am vegetarian, mostly, so we eat a lot of rice and a lot of salad. How do you make it exciting? Sesame works. You can grind away on this thing for hours to release steam and pass off the results of your hard work as annual holiday gifts. Better than grinding your teeth like all type-A personalities and, let's face it, if you are not a type-A personality, would you really own a sesame grinder?
