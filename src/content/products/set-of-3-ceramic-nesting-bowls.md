These bowls are perfectly designed with ideal proportions and color. Each fulfills a specific need: the smallest as a rice bowl, the largest for udon or any other soup. They are also great serving dishes as the three look beautiful on the table together. We like to use them with our red dot tenugui (as napkins) to get a circular motif going. They are ceramic and finished with a very durable glaze - with the exception of the foot of each bowl, which is unfinished. This small detail makes the pieces all the more interesting. They are really well thought-out and the perfect wedding gift. The set comes in a beautiful wooden box.
