How can you resist a little face cream with a theatrical purpose? The pink one is rose scented; the other is a neutral, well, face-cream scent. I cannot vouch for its effectiveness on the face, only the hands. I carry one of these in my bag, I like it better than a tube that tends to get smooshed and then when I open it the contents go flying out. Very compact.
