My lips are really not that dry, but sometimes while walking in the woods, not only do I want to hug a tree, but I'd like to kiss it too! Smack! There you go, sweet willow! Ah, hugs, chuggs! It feels better to douse those lips with balm before distributing kisses (and I now know, after, too). But why am I never getting a hug back? And kisses - only the needley conifers tend to return them - all over my face when I least expect it.
