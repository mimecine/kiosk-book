A hot and spicy pepper powder.  
Good on top of almost anything.  
Egg or steamed vegetable...  
Found in any reputable izakaya.  
Our favorite is called Koto no Fuji  
near Idabashi station;  
owned by an ex-sumo wrestler.  
Eggplant with dashi,  
tiny clam in broth with scallion,  
tofu with chinese spices, sweet, pickled scallion.  
Say we sent you!  
This spice has been made since the Edo period.  
That's 18th century.
