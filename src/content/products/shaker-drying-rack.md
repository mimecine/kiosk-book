Yet another brilliant Shaker solution. We first came across the drying rack at Canterbury Shaker Village in New Hampshire, one of the few Shaker colonies left that one can visit. The Shakers derived from the Quaker religion; Ann Lee, or "Mother Ann," whom they believed to be the female manifestation of Christ, founded the movement in the United States, arriving in New York City in 1774. Over the next century, they built up a following of some 200,000 converts - however, at this point there are only four Shakers left. Shakers are well known for their tremendous craftsmanship, ideas and ingenious objects, furniture, tools and architecture. Their incredible output is largely explained by their oath of celibacy. One of the most outstanding buildings I have ever visited is the round barn at Hancock Shaker Village in Massachusetts. The interior construction is an echo of Tatlin's Constructivist tower, but it was constructed close to a hundred years prior. The drying rack is a beautiful piece of art - almost too lovely to use, but you have to. We tend to air dry our clothes more and more to save on time at the laundromat, help the environment, save money and spare our clothes the beating of the tumble drier. It is a shame all of the rooftop laundry lines have been forbidden in New York due to insurance issues. Yes, we have rigged an illegal laundry-hanging device on our rooftop, but on a rainy day, this drying rack is incredibly handy. The wood is unfinished, so it will age down. The piece folds flat to become only 3" thick. I found a perfect storage spot in the gap between my refrigerator and wall. Hanging it on a peg or a nail is an appropriate solution as well.
