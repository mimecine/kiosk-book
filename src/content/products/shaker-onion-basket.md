A cocoon for your onions. This will keep them from getting that weird, dusty mold that you only notice when you go to make some salsa. It also smells like a hayride through the forest on a fall day. Wood & hay, happy onions, happy garlic, happy Shakers - thank you for your invention. Made by the incredibly industrious Beverly Lussier.
