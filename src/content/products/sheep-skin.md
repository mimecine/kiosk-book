You have wool socks, you eat lamb chops, why not go all the way and use the best part of the sheep? Use it in the classical way: as a throw over your couch or a cuddle rug under your TV. If you really know what's what, you will use it as an avant-garde cape; and if you are in the front row at a fashion show, maybe they would even make Anna move over so you could get a better view, but I doubt it. If you are seated by Ms. Wintour she would most certainly take notice of your warm and fashion-forward cape. Here at Kiosk fur is a no-no, so please don't come in wearing one; using all parts of the animal, however, is A\-ok as long as they are raised with care and love. I'd like to live in an all-vegetarian world, but unfortunately my wish is not the command.
