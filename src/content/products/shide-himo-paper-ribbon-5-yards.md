This ribbon is made of paper and is extremely durable and flexible. It is old fashioned and is commonly used in food shops that sell Japanese sweets or crackers to tie up packages and bundles \- much like how bakery twine is used in the United States. Slowly, it has been going out of fashion, but traditional stores continue to use it. It has a very natural texture and feel. It is very handy - easy to tie and untie.
