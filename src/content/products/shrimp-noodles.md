Mr. Ye's shop is located on Pell Street in the Central area of Hong Kong. Pell Street and another called Graham were established as market streets in 1841, the same year the British appropriated Hong Kong. Now, it seems, much like British rule, the old street-market days have come to an end as plans are under way to "renovate" the area. Hopefully the residents can halt "progress." The owner was very reluctant to sell us noodles, he was BUSY! and he was not in the mood to bundle up bags of noodles, it seemed, especially for us. But as time passed he grew warmer and suddenly we were in the back room watching him in noodle-making mode. (Exactly what he wanted to get back to.) With the day's noodles drying over his head, Mr. Ye proceeded to show us his process; his hands are as quick as his temper! He told us about learning the trade from his father and how he has been on television many times, a celebrity! Tossing the dough around he fed it into the machine, which pressed the noodles out, and then he tossed them into the drying tray. These are shrimp-flavored noodles that are especially good for soup; we also sell an egg-flavored variant. Unlike the ramen you get in supermarkets these are full of flavor! One noodle bunch per serving!
