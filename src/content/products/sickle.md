Honestly, this is just an amazing hand-forged tool. I'm not going to BS you, I have no experience with this thing. I did not see it in some old farmer's hand. I can't say I hugged the maker when I visited him in his workshop. No, this is pure object-nut eye candy, plain and simple. Indeed, these are still commonly used around Greece. You'll likely have no need for this, and we only have one to sell. If you want it, buy it, use it, and let us know what you have to say; we will quote you here.
