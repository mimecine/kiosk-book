Juice from a family-owned orchard in the south of Sweden. The blend of apples decides the final taste - early summer fruit gives more acid and less sugar and winter fruit gives a rich, full-bodied, sweet juice. The juice is pasteurized and contains only 100% apples. It is incredibly pure and tasty. The last one we tried had a crisp, tart flavor. Absolutely addictive.
