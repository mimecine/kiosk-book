A Swedish drawing pad with wire coil. Paper on a heavy backing is easier to use on the go. I have been close to the Skissblock since 1996 and I never grow tired of it. I like the paper quality and the logo. Best yet, it is produced from recycled paper left over from large printing jobs. A nice smooth and thin paper for easy processing and doodle light. I often make books of line drawings when I am traveling, as the camera can overwhelm me. See Walter Benjamin for explanation.
