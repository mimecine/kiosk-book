A slanted lamp socket, but why? And why not - or rather, and why? After all, the angle makes it easier to remove the bulb and put it back into the socket. Conceived to be mounted on the wall with a glass globe covering the bulb, but certainly for simplicity's sake it can be used without the cover. The most important information I can provide you is to use it and every other socket or lamp in the house with an energy-saving bulb. Yes, I also believe those bulbs don't cast the nicest light but it only takes time to adjust, and if we were all bothered a little, a lot of energy saving would happen. There is no denying that's a good thing.
