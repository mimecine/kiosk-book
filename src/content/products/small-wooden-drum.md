Poom! Poom! Poom! Here comes the marching band, marching down the street. Didn't you always want to be the one with the drums, banging away, keeping the time, making the most noise, and holding it all together? Throw the rope over your shoulder and get to work, leading the band down the block and around the corner. Poom! Poom! Poom! We visited the family who makes this drum. The father resembles Geppetto, seriously. I don't know how they make everything they do, with only two people and machines that aremore than 100 years old. Their bandsaw looked like a sideboard, because the bottom half was! Their toys must come to life and help at night; it is the only explanation. The toys at Walmart are so sad, trapped in their boxes and plastic. Boo hoo hoo. NOTE! the images vary on this product. If you love love love this image,please let us know; otherwise, trust us to choose one for you. Honestly, we like each and every one we have!
