I have been a fan of nougat for as long as I can remember. Are you familiar with Russell Stover chocolates? They are the American greatness in candy (sorry, don't hate me). Peers are OFTEN turned off by the fact I still claim Russell Stover to be my favorite chocolate; a close second is Wittamer in Brussels. We are what we eat, and apparently everyone is hooked on the chocolate they were raised with. I used to search the mixed box of chocolates for the pink nougat, pink being my favorite color; I had to have everything pink, I was pink-obsessed! Something about the chewy, sweet, nutty combination just drove me nutty too, meow! Apparently peanuts are not common in nougat but this one is loaded with them. I have not had much luck researching Smith's Confectionery. I found that they are in Kwun Tong, where most of the Hong Kong factories were built in the 1950s; based on their graphics, I assume they may have been established in 1951?
