Oh, tired of riding your bike around town and having things flying off? Get snelbinders and never again lose, say, a box of things you cherish highly. Travel at a high velocity and never have fear about the bumps to come. Fixed to your wheel axle, snelbinders bind almost anything to a rat trap - as long as it's cherished, that is. Snel means "quick" in Dutch, so we are talking the opposite of snails' pace here! And yum: it looks like licorice. The Duimdrop is, in a way, similar in texture.
