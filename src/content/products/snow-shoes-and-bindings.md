I have a fantasy about using these in the woods near where we live in Stockholm. Truth be told, I have never used snowshoes, so I can't share any personal anecdotes here. I can only talk about how I long to be in nature, alone and as close as possible, and I believe these snowshoes will take me to where I want to be - both literally and figuratively. Snowshoes distribute your weight evenly on top of the snow, stopping you from sinking in. From what I hear, snowshoes are like ice skates. You get the flow down by doing a slight two-step and the world of snow suddenly opens up to you. Lean, lift, down. Made by Iverson, the last wooden snowshoe maker in the United States. The frames of these shoes are rounded in the back and the front for maneuverability, and unlike aluminum snowshoes, they are silent, a key element in the woods. You are maybe concerned about wood vs. aluminum regarding strength and durability. Iverson uses ash, which is strong, flexible, and durable. The shoes hold up to 200 pounds. The only maintenance required is to brush on marine varnish once a year and they will last you several lifetimes. The harnesses look complicated but they are really easy, just a few pulls and away you go. Here I go!
