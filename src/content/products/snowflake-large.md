A beautiful star based on a traditional Amish snowflake we found in Pennsylvania. Made by Beverly who makes a fantastic Shaker onion basket, even though she is not a Shaker and FYI she is not Amish. That does not make this object any less valid. Hang in the window, put on top of a Christmas tree, place in the garden for the birds and watch it age, stare into the center and allow yourself to drift away. Have a great end of 2012 and an even better 2013.
