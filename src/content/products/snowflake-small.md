All you need is one of these to celebrate Winter. Right now we are decorating the shop for Christmas and Marco is hanging a snowflake on our tree. Although Kiosk can be a crazy place I feel right at home here and I hope you do too when you come in. Do put one of these in your kitchen, near your outdoor thermometer, on your standing lamp, in your shower and chill out on this beautiful thing. Go there in 2013, enjoy!
