We call it a "soap cage". The Dutch call it a _zeepklopper_ or "soap beater". However you say it, perfect for all your on-the-road, need-to-do wash, and traveling-in foreign-places-with-no-laundromats-to-be-found scenarios. Place a bar of laundry soap inside and swish it around the water - suddenly you will find yourself with a nice, sudsy brew for washing your dirty stuffs while on the road. If you like to travel light, bring this along, or if you like to do some hand-washing, have this at home. My fine goods do not get tossed into the American washers! Abuse!
