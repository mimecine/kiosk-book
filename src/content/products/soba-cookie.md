Itâ€™s interesting - these are called  
soba cookies.  
Soba is, in fact,  
a noodle.  
Both the cookie and the noodle  
are made of buckwheat.  
According to a friend,  
people like to eat the cookie in milk.  
Cookie and noodle, both in liquids?  
Makes sense.  
Crunchy.  
Like fried soba.  
Cookies are in the same shape  
as the green flowers on the bag.
