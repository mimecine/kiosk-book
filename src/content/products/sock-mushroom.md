Once you have a pair of socks you like it is hard to throw them away, no? Something many of us have long forgotten is - you can darn them! Place the hole in the sock on the top of the sock mushroom and stitch away in a circular pattern. Such things are nearly extinct these days. Help preserve darning - darn a sock!
