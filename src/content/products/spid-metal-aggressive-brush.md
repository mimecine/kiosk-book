Feeling pissed off at the paint drying? Hate the fu\*\*\*ng iron that just wants to rust to dust? Have a say to your physical, inanimate neighbors with this abrasively handy tool. Get them in line. Rust-away, chip-away, Spid at them! They deserve it. The name of the brush says it all, no, not SPID, but the word that starts with an A. What molding in that handle! Nameplate please.
