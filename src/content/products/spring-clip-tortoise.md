If you are looking for that  kind of French elegance and you have a pretty good head of hair this could be something for you. Look around when you are in Paris, it's obvious, French women know how to handle their locks. How they do it has mystified me for decades but I have noticed, from young to old, all ages know how to tie, twist, pin and clip their hair in the most natural and subtly sexy way. I have to wonder is this something that is taught? Part of the curriculum? Or are they born with a certain talent and skill. I have seen it all over the country so there is no doubt it's from top to bottom, left to right and it's working for them on the hi and the low, from all styles and all types of twists. I guess it's just one of those things, like Americans and peanut butter. This clip, handmade in France, does hold a key, oui, and your hair looks even better when it is let down, knock-out.
