Though not as sturdy as our Japanese counterpart, this knife takes up less space and would easily fit in your wallet, for example. I could see a potential greatness in a robbery situation if you pulled this out of your wallet instead of a library card and some receipts when they ask for cash. Gotcha! Although if they take the entire wallet, tables will be turned and you will be in double-trouble instead. Mind you, it is much sharper than my mind.
