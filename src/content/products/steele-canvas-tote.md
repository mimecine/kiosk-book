"Steele" seems an apt name for such a bag. You could carry girders or thousands and thousands of ball bearings in this bag, no problem. You might think the handles are short, but they won't get all floppy after you break this bag in (which will require many trips up and down the stairs with 200 lbs of ball bearings \- you will be exhausted, but your bag will not). Speaking of wear, the bottom is reinforced with a nice green color that won't look filthy when you place it on the subway floor to make way for the man with the cane to sit. Steele makes plenty of bags for armored cars, hence, the bag will stay open when you put it down \- one hand on the gun, one hand putting the money in the bag. The Steele family is a tight\-knit group of family members and workers (who play cards at lunch) that have known each other for years. They greeted us with a huge welcome and gave us a tour of their operations from top to bottom. I really enjoyed it there \- good people making good products!
