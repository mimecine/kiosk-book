Of course it is priced, but not with stickers! So, there is really no need for sticker remover in nature unless you want to get a bottle of this, sit under a tree and remove all the stickers in your life. De-sticking in nature. Those tacky UPC stickers really make everything look so cheap, so remove them! In Japan, where beauty and simplicity often reign, they know how.
