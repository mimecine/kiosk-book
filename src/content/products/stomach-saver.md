Whoa, my stomach was not feeling itself in Germany with all the cheese, bread, knödel and spätzel. I found there is little to eat on the run in Germany if you are a vegetarian, and everything I did find was included in the short list above - veggies are not King. I complained about this and my stomach to the friend we were staying with, having two young children, she is well-versed in remedies and provided me with Iberogast, as only natural remedies will do. It worked so well I got a personal supply to carry with me while on the road. My husband thought I was crazy to sell it, he said, "Oh yeah, people are going to say, 'I got this great stomach remedy at that really cool design shop in Soho.'" Uh, it is a little weird, but KIOSK is not about a category of goods, rather a state of mind. Instructions in English inside.
