Athens's version of tenements all have courtyards that frequently double as tavernas. More than a few times we found this model, or a similar stove, being used for the oozier parts of Greek cuisine (say, five of the ten items on the Greek menu - it’s delicious but short). Specifically Greek? No, not really, but we seldom come across a three-burner stove. And personally I can’t resist brown speckled enamel, either. It hides dirt! It hardly stains! So it came back with us. It has a quarter-inch barb fitting so BYO(j)G - bring your own (jazzy) gas (and regulator and hose and clamp). If we can get it to work, so can you. A unique challenge to the recipient, if you give it as a gift! Marco hooked it up to a simple propane canister. Once operational, you get three formidable, beautiful flames, perfect for outdoor (or tiny-apartment) cooking. The two burners are compact, yet give ample cooking space. The middle burner is usually set aside for coffee. I watched a man cook for an entire outdoor restaurant on one of these. They're much better than the electric burner in my kitchen. Does that thing even boil water? The only drawback is now I have no excuse not to cook.
