Don't let your pots of egg curry burn! Diffuse it! Also can be used to diffuse arguments with husbands and others by taking the diffuser to the bottom. Perfect for electric stovetops that take forever to cool down and refuse to let water simmer. More and more kitchens are strictly electric and I do not know how one can stand it. In New York we live in a loft with two electric burners and cooking is largely hopeless, but then, who cooks at home New York any longer? In Stockholm they threatened to remove our gas, they failed, I won that argument. It's amazing what the power of positive thinking and a bit of yelling in shrill English can do in a foreign country. However, I always calculate well before I let it out of the can as one time in France it backfired on me. Because, although the French care about diffusers and are careful not to burn their ratatouille, they could care less about an American having her handbag stolen on a Saturday afternoon. Damn them and their diffusers found in every respectable French household, this diffuser comes from The Netherlands.
