Meat. Romania, it's all about meat. I knew that before going and it almost killed the trip but we went and damned if I did eat meat! I did. Marco was overjoyed! Oh yay, we can now cook meat at home! After 30 years, Romania broke me down - it's a long story and I feel bad, but hell, it was yummy. I have tried to enjoy meat since I returned and, interestingly, I do not enjoy the juice. However, to test my faith, when we returned, much to Marco's triple joy, we tested this indoor, stovetop grill at our house. I did not believe it would work but it does, yep, it in fact worked so well it smoked/stunk the place up - some people call that delicious, but meat was once again a no-no in our home and Marco was sad. The way it works is you place the open end of the grill over a gas burner, turn the flame up pretty high and the heat of the burner essentially ricochets off the top of the lid, grilling your meat to perfection. We cooked sausages, turning them once - it was amazing. No really, just like a BBQ. The meat rests on a wire rack under the lid and the tray below catches the juices. It's not easy being a once-vegetarian, then-pescetarian, then-meat eater then-vegetarian again. It's not easy being green.
