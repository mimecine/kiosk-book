I can't tell you how many years I've been looking for this size strainer. Perfect for delicious Greek grapes, or a pile of tender ripe tomatoes. Good for defrosting a package of spinach. A certain Greek yogurt manufacturer props up the New York state economy and the Greeks don't see one thin dime of it. It's all made here; everyone knows that. Not everyone knows how to make Greek yogurt at home with such a strainer, but this is not about that. This is about draining pasta, or diffusing light, or having something to wear on your head to block out electromagnetic waves when all hell breaks loose.
