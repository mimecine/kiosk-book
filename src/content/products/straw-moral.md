As I mentioned under the recycled plastic moral, men in the countryside of Mexico use a moral. They take it with them, often carrying a machete as well, into the fields for a day's work. It is made of a natural fiber and produced locally. Made to last, they get more and more interesting with time and age and hold up under abuse.
