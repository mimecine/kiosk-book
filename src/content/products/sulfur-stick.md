Do you have aches and pains? This item is a totally, non-scientifically proven,  antiquated homeopathic / home remedy brought back by some Genoese sailor in the 1800s from a mysterious place overseas but hey, it works for me! One stick for one user. Simply roll over aches, pains and places in the body that crackle and pop. The story goes that the sulfur grabs the air sitting inside those aches and others and the crackling noise you hear the stick make as you roll away is it absorbing the extra air in the body, the extra air that gives you those pains. When the stick cracks apart, with quite a loud pop I should note, the pain should be dissolved.  Does the pain abate thanks to the rolling massage or is it in fact the sulfur working its tricks on you? The pharmacist advised me to use it 2 times a day for about 3 minutes at a time. Common in Luguria but nowhere else. I find nothing about them on the internet. Ironically, I have read sulfur is a common homeopathic remedy for middle-aged women. Sometimes when I am lazy I tuck it into my turtleneck, etc rather than roll and it continues to randomly crackle but only when I place it on spots where I have pain. Oddly, it does work. Placebo? Thank you to Fattobene for showing us this object.
