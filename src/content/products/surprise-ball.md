One day our colleague Ming, mentioned Gina, her mother’s friend, makes a something called a "Surprise Ball". Sounds interesting, intriguing. A few weeks later Gina wrote she had mailed Ming and I a package - a Surprise Ball for each of us. The box arrived, I opened the package and it sat there, I was not sure what to do. You know, I look at A LOT of stuff all the time but this was REALLY cool, like goo-goo eyes, whoa-ness. I wasn’t sure if it was my place to disturb this round object. I asked Gina to explain; she summed it up so well I quote her here: “From as far back as I can remember, be it a ring from a gum-ball vending machine, a Cracker Jack prize, the thrill of a piñata, Christmas stocking treats, I have always been drawn to small things. The desire to include items that are ephemeral, whimsical, charming and/or amusing set mine apart from others - this is what I hope. It’s the quality of the goods (and sometimes the rarity) that matters...for some it may be hard to open (and I kind of like that) but people are never disappointed by what they find inside.” Open the ball, or not, the choice is yours. If cracked, inside you will find a minimum of 15 astounding and well-chosen surprises. Every object is a rare thing, mostly vintage treasures from all over the world. Something to indulge one person with or a prize for a group of people to share around the table, passing on, spreading the joy, unwinding around and around.
