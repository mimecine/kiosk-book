Sometimes simplicity is key. This whisk is pleasing to the eye and as efficient as a whisk can be. Some swear it is much more efficient than the classical "bulb" whisk the rest of the world is using. Users of the Swedish whisk are in a minority, as it is not as globally known as the French one. However, there are very clever inventors in Sweden, and most things from there are thought over many times before leaving the drawing board - so they just might be right about this whisk. My favorite use for it is whisking cream and eggs, particularly when the two come together to make Swedish pancakes.
