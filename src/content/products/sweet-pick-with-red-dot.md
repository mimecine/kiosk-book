Courtly, refined, stately?  
Nobody says these words  
and if they do, they are really just thinking "classy."  
Why can't I just say "classy" without sounding trashy?  
Let's go ahead and start saying "classy" without irony.  
Let's start with this sweet pick.  
Because nothing is classier than eating some cantaloupe or pineapple -  
not with your fingers,  
but with this sweet pick  
with a red dot near the business-end  
and your pinky sticking out.
