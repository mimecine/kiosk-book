Way back in 2006, we launched our second collection - Sweden. In it, we included a Swedish military weekend bag which was promptly discontinued by the military, in advance of military service being eliminated in Sweden. Marco brought his military bag to Switzer in Amsterdam and asked them what they could do with it. Here is the result. A special bag made by special people for a special person in a very limited quantity.
