Harvey from Joseph Treu, where we get our stamps made, presented me with his used target as a gift one day. Through the shredded paper I could make out something good. While we were in downtown Orlando, this character came into my thoughts. Mainly because his wife-beater tank, bandana and the shapes surrounding him are all very 80s and large parts of Florida are still trapped in the 80s (Jimmy Buffet...oh yeah). We offer you the poster without the gunshots - I am not licensed - but you too can have this Floridian man as a pin-up or a target poster. I find it interesting that he is made in New Jersey, my home state. My guess is he is a ruffian from New Jersey in a Miami Vice episode.
