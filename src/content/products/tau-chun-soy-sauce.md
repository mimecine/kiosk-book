In the very center of the fancy, fresh, brand-new Hong Kong lies a quite dirty but very inspiring market. When people talk about Hong Kong looking like the sets of Blade Runner, they probably speak of this area. Giant, shiny, evil-looking skyscrapers interspersed with colorful, stinky market stands (oh, can they stink sometimes!) selling weird (to us) foods and goods. In the very center of that market you can find a cave. Ok, it's not really a cave, but a really old shop. It had - if I remember right - dirt floors (maybe just that dirty) and hardly any lighting. The shop was selling only two kinds of soy sauce and a vinegar that were produced in the dark depths of that very store. I wonder what was going on in the back - all we saw were shadows and glimpses of people. Every now and then we heard shouts. I'm pretty sure this was just another CIA safe house. A front! Yeah, it's all a front! So this must be the secret soy sauce that secret CIA agents have on their secret dumplings. As we left the store, we saw a secret CIA cat strutting out the door and following us for a block or so. We shook it off pretty easy.
