Hong Kong-style milk tea is similar to the milk tea in Britain, but it calls for evaporated or condensed milk rather than regular milk. It is a colonial holdover, as Chinese tea is never taken with milk or sugar. It is also known as dai pai dong milk tea (dai pai dongs are the open-air food stalls that are quickly disappearing in Hong Kong) and it is often served in cha chaan tengs, which are like Hong Kong-style diners. To make milk tea it is common to use Ceylon tea but often vendors make their own "special" black tea blends. In theory the tea is brewed in a tea sock to make the tea smoother. Over time the tea sock turns brown; this has led to another name for milk tea, "pantyhose milk tea." I think "silk stocking milk tea" is sexier and noir. Either version is not particularly appetizing but milk tea is, and the tea sock makes for a smooth cup of tea.
