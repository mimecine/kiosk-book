We like big numbers. Five zeroes after any one-to-nine look a lot better on this calculator than on your standard Casio, Texas Instruments, or the one you got as a promo piece from the bank for opening a checking account. Ka-Ching. This might be the very embodiment of (as-of-recent history) Hong Kong as the center of the manufacturing universe. The micro-factories of Hong Kong that churned out items like these were the basis of the roaring economic upswing this tiny place had in the latter part of last century. Now that was Cash Money with at least seven zeroes or more!
