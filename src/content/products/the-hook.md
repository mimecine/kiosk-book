The companion to the S-hook we also feature, this boat-hook-like thing is mounted on the top of a stick and used to lift the S-hook and whatever is hooked onto the S-hook. Hooked yet? Do you have exposed pipes in the ceiling? This, with the S-hook, will save you a lot of floor space and show your guests, I don't know, your collection of flip-flops in a net bag, for example. So cool, you now know how to spell icehookey!
