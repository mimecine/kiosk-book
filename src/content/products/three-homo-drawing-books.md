Don't judge a book by its cover. These notebooks come in three sizes and colors - for drawing or just scrapping around town. We like to glue inspiration into the notebooks, so the tie becomes essential when the book gets thick. They're perfect as a photo album too. We get a lot of questions about the name. In the 1980s, it was common for J-English (Japanese-English) to run amok. These days, sadly, most of it has been corrected. Gone are the days when a tough guy going to the corner 7-11, would be wearing his girlfriend's slippers and a t-shirt saying "I Rike Young Boy!". The cute thing about this very serious Japanese company is that they either don't know about the implications of their name or they don't care. Either way, these are great notebooks with high quality paper.
