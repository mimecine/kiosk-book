Everybody loves swallows. They remind sailors of home or being at sea for 5,000 miles. They make cute little houses in the eaves of farmers' roofs. They are the ones that fly in a big group around sunset in those crazy patterns that make you wonder how they all turn at the same time, every time. Now you can have some of your own without putting one in a cage or having to feed it.
