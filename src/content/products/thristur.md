Thristur, or “Three”, is named for its three ingredients: chocolate, chocolate whipped filling and licorice. Mmmmm, tastes like a really good version of a Milky Way with the addition of tubes of licorice running the length. This is Kólus’s most popular item, and, at thirty five years old, you can understand why. It’s unique and tasty and totally addictive. Over the ages, many have tried to copy the Thristur magic and none have succeeded. By the way, that funky “P” in the name is actually “Th” in English.
