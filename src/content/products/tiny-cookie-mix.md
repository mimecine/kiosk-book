Baby cookie mix.  
To go with cups of tea.  
As you can see by the list of ingredients,  
there are as many types of cookies inside.  
If you have a problem eating something  
so beautiful,  
think of your mouth as a dish  
and the cookies as potpourri.  
Then proceed to fill the dish  
with the potpourri.
