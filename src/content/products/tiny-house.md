Peter King is a fabulous person - one of those who build their own houses. We had the fortune of joining one of his workshops where you get to build a tiny, tiny house. Not as tiny as the one we are showing here, but a tiny-large house you can live in, 10 feet by 10 feet. Some people can only do it for a few days, but we have found we can live there for longer times. The trip was a trip. It deserves its own post, although not everything would be fit for words. The workshop was not so much a way to learn how to make a house as it was to give some solid understanding of framing - the invention that sparked the great housing boom after WWII, made necessary by the baby boom. Boom! This is a model - Peter uses it for explaining the parts and concepts of framing. So, if you have a constructive itch to scratch and don't know where to start or how to reach that itch, this will get you covered - one of the sticks will certainly help you reach your back if nothing more. Thanks, Peter, for the amazing experience and help in teaching us how to build our own house . He's a brilliant teacher and we hope you will visit him, too.
