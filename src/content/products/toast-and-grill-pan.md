It's a fire! Oh no, it's only my toast! Damn - I did it again, burnt! But it tastes sooooo good \- fire it up, I can't stop the eatin'. Looking beyond the land of bread, this handy pan works magic on peppers and eggplants too, roasting and toasting them to a perfectly black and burnt outside, the one you peel off before eating. Other than that, the pan's not a winner. But how many uses do you have for your toaster?
