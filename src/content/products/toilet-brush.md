Scrub-a-dub-dub, but not your teeth or your tub with this dandy little item. What is it with most toilet brushes? They come with a strange, futuristic holder that leaks and falls over. They come in weird colors and shapes that you wouldn't normally have around the house. Let's call it the toilet brush exception. You bother to paint the walls, have all the right lotions and potions, you have some matching towels and a cute shower curtain. Don't fall prey to the exception. I know it's a bit eighties, but where best to keep the eighties than next to the toilet?
