The sheets that take care of your butt deserve this. They're on a roll now, but that luck will go down the toilet very soon. An object commonly found in the finer, more ancient bathrooms of Stockholm, Sweden and other European towns. Designed originally to keep the paper dry in open shower scenarios where the entire bathroom becomes drenched due to a lack of wet enclosure. This event consistently confuses Americans who never understand the reason for such small washrooms. Alas, ancient homes in the old world had closets but not WC's and hence often todays WC's are the closets of yesteryear. I do find the metal flap to be handy as it prevents too much coming off the roll at once. On an end note I have to mentionÂ chrome is stylish throughout the ages.
