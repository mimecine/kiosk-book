Hung over one's doorway to act as a welcomer, the toran most often consists of fresh mango leaves or fake variations like ours here. It, in theory, absorbs negative vibes and showers you with positive ones. What a decorative object! The maker thought it was very funny that I thought the orange teardrop represented a coconut rather than a mango. I did not get the joke.
