I hate housework, do you? Turn that frown upside down with the Tote Max - it makes things happy around the home or office! Very colorful. We have one near our front door as an in-and-out box. Nicknamed the M.U.T.T. (Maximum Utility Tote Tray), you won't look ugly with this cutie pie around! Sturdy, it is molded with FORTALLOYÂ®, a rubber-polymer blend - it's tough stuff. Kick it and find out! Just kidding...it is a really practical and helpful object; we walked around the neighborhood with a quarter of the KIOSK collection inside, photographing as we went along. It fits a lot and really can take a beating!
