A baby carrier used until the baby grows up and then repurposed for carrying or displaying anything one likes. I saw one in the market overflowing with mint. The baby is wrapped in a thick cloth and then using a strap, the carrier rests on the mothers back. The little thing can't move around, but then again, it seems to be comforting as I did not hear much crying from Mexican children whether they were in the carrier or out. We saw tiny ones for new borns and larger ones for babies up to one year old.
