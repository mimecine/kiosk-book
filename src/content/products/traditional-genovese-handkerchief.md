Just your typical _mandillu da gruppu_ from Liguria. A basic, common, decent sized piece of cloth used to tie up your harvest, lunch, mushrooms, break, picnic, for example. Once untied it will cover a small table or create a nice platform for your Sunday afternoon in the park with or without George (see Sondheim). It's possible to wear it as a scarf although you may feel you are wearing a tablecloth around your neck aka: a bib. In fact I think it would be very handy as a companion to a small child as it is very lightweight and hides stains well. This is one of those cloths one uses to shreds and it gets better and better with the more stains, marks and patches it has. Nice with denim as well. The more I stare at it, the more versatile it becomes. Thank you to Fattobene for showing us this object.
