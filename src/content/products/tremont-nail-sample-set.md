We were on our way home after touring Massachusetts for three weeks. I was tired, cranky and hungry, not to mention the fact that my back was killing after sitting in the car for so long. We had just entered the Turnpike via an open gate in a McDonald's parking lot - don't even ask. I am telling you: we wanted to get home fast. We took a random exit and beat it to find the nearest diner, which we eventually found in Mansfield. Through the mist of delirium, we were drawn to a large wooden structure with a large TREMONT NAIL CO sign on the roof. It was beautiful, such an amazing building for America's oldest nail manufacturer, established in 1819. Tremont was bought by Acorn some years back. Their machines were moved to Acorn's operations nearby in MA. The current product is just as good, because the new company is equally devoted to making a range of high-quality hardened-steel nails. With this sample set, you can marvel at their selection and read about Tremont Nails - a thrill for any American history/furniture/construction buff. Ross said we should send it to Sarah Palin (and you could certainly add John Boehner) with the note: "Here are some nails for America's coffin."
