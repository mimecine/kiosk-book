You know, I sat down to write about Turtle Tree Seeds, and after reading their text, I thought to myself, I could not sum it up better. So I have copied their text into the Garden Seed Set we made of their seeds. On another note, I can tell you why I go biodynamic: respect the Earth and respect what you eat! Love the plants and the ones you eat! That's all, folks. What we offer from Turtle Tree is a selection I would start my own garden with. You can also buy the set of seeds at a decent discount. Start growing your own food today, and, if you have kids, introduce them to the world by seeing the veggies they eat grow from one little seed into a nettle soup, a great big zucchini, or a kale and red pepper tortilla with grated carrot with a mizuna salad on the side. Then they can wash it all down with some fresh valerian tea and sleep on it. This fantasy is OK for adults, too.
