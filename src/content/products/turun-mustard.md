Yes, although considered to be a national icon (Turun mustard and sausages), this product is no longer made in Finland; several years ago, it was bought by a Swedish company so it is now produced in Uppsala, Sweden. Named for the city Turku and made since 1926. It was something of an outrage that a Swedish company could own Turun Sinappi, being that it is a nationalistic brand. Especially outrageous as Sweden ruled Finland for hundreds of years and, until recently, it was mandatory for Finns to study Swedish in school. Swedish remains the second language of the country and 5-6% of the Finnish population are Swedish-speaking Finns. We found there is a good amount of animosity between Finns and Swedes; I won’t go into detail, but it was made fairly clear in a quiet sort of way. My husband is Swedish and we found it was a good thing not to brag about it while traveling. Swedes themselves consider Finns to be quite mad and, in Swedish terms, they are a bit. Thank god! Turku is called Åbo in Swedish and is located in the southwest part of the country where most of the Finnish-Swedes are located. I think handing over Turku Mustard to a Swedish company was a little like handing territory back to Sweden - a national tragedy. A substitute Finnish made product using the Turun mustard recipe came on the market calledAurun Mustard; I tried it and it was not the same, sorry.
