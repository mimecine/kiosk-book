A lamp to hang or sit, made from one piece of Dakota Burl, scored to make breaking easy. Break according to instructions, tie up with the enclosed cord, and you are ready to go. Neon yellow paper on the inside creates a powerful glow. It comes from within! Ugly and cute. Durable and delicious. Created with environmental issues from deep in the brain. Conceived by Swedish design/art/architecture group UGLYCUTE for KIOSK as part of Mini-Exhibition #7, "UGLYCUTE: Experiments in Dakota Burl."
