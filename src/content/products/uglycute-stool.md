A stool made from one piece of Dakota Burl, scored to make breaking easy. Break according to instructions and fasten one wing nut to have your seat ready for use. Ugly and cute. Durable and delicious. Created with environmental issues from deep in the brain. Conceived by Swedish design/art/architecture-group UGLYCUTE for KIOSK as part of Mini-Exhibition #7, "UGLYCUTE: Experiments in Dakota Burl".
