Since 1857, Eitaro has been making Edo-style Japanese sweets.  
This candy is their specialty.  
It is based on the Portuguese alf√©loa.  
Do you know the Portuguese were the first Europeans to reach Japan?  
The candy is essentially a mass of sugar  
shaped as a plum.  
The colors are a saturated  
red and golden yellow.  
Echoing the red plum and the yellow plum  
and the two colors of umeboshi.  
Nice tin.
