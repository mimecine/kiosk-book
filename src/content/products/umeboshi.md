Don't mess with my umeboshi. One a day, popped straight from the jar into the mouth keeps me running, a humming. Most folks feel it's too much due to its incredibly strong and salty flavor but that's what keeps me fit. Umeboshi is a savory plum pickle and in this case, colored naturally by red shiso leaves and produced by a small producer in Oakland, CA in the traditional way. THAT is what makes this umeboshi special. Often the umeboshi I find in the states from Japan are artificially dyed and processed but these have a special goodness and purity. Umeboshi are a folk remedy in Japan, if you can't eat one whole like I do, put it in hot water and mash it up a bit in the glass or eat some, piece by piece, with steamed rice in the morning. It's also very nice in salads; the maker suggests tossing one umeboshi into some greens and massaging until you are left with a bare pit. Mmmmmm. I am so into these I use every drop; when the last plum is gone I pour hot water into the jar enjoying the final bit of the liquid.
