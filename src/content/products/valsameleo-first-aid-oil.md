Also goes by the name "spatholado," as every Greek word seems to have a multitude of translations and spellings in English. Historically, valsameleo was used on the battlefield. There were a lot of battles going on in ancient Greece, and naturally, quite a few battle wounds that needed attention. The ancient Spartans used valsameleo as a healing oil. Spartans! Since St. John's wort is known today as a natural antidepressant, I wonder if the formula actually makes people happier, enacting some mental \- rather than just physical \- healing. I did get a nasty cut on my hand when I was in Athens, and it did heal very fast when I used valsameleo in place of Neosporin. Good for rashes, cuts, scrapes, aches, burns \- almost any malady or injury, won in battle or not.
