We had taco night here at KIOSK the other evening. Margaritas were on the menu, naturally, but damn, they were strong. Maggie was killing me! The drinks needed to be mellowed out. I was out of vanilla extract, so we tipped a bunch of vanilla powder into the blend, and what was lightning strong became smooth sailing. Sitting in the hammock swing, tipping back one glass after another, it was like I was back out at sea. There was moonlight and easy laughter. Friends came in and out of view, and there was a wind. After a while, the ride got a bit more rocky, and I yelled out to Marco to batten down the hatches. Then, all at once, the storm calmed down, and the sun rose up out of nowhere. My goodness, the party was over, and I had one hell of a hangover when the lights came on. Vanilla powder made the drinks a little too smooth, perhaps? Good for baking as well.
