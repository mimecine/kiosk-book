A vintage piece... We came across this car when we were walking from one market devoted to automobile parts and rubber (never found out the name of it) to the Sonora market in Mexico City. It was a completely random and very lucky find. I spotted the store from across the street, it was loaded with vintage toys but they also made Japanese food and seemed to have some sort of a bakery going as well. The choices were endless. The owner was a fanatic and the store was kind of my dream shop. He had four of these cars, two with pink windows and two with blue; I decided to buy them all. The timing was strange; after being surrounded by automobile parts of all kinds, suddenly I was buying them all at once in miniature. I was definitely drawn to the butterscotch color and the quality of the plastic. He told us they were from the '70s and I believe him, he really knows his stuff.
