Produced by the family-owned company White Cross, Vitalis was first manufactured in 1936. Containing no water, it protects the skin against cold weather, wind and sun. It has a SPF of 8. Apply before going out into the cold to protect your skin. Of course, we show our finds to some of the local population before deciding whether to include an object in the collection. Time after time, I heard stories of how, as children, Vitalis was rubbed onto the cheeks to protect against the cold. The fragrance has remained unchanged since the 30s. This, the design of the can and these stories makes the product quite nostalgic.
