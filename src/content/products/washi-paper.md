Made by Isetastu,  
who has been making washi papers since  
the Edo period.  
As such, their offerings are varied and diverse.  
It was hard to choose only one.  
This print is made by hand with wood blocks.  
It was designed in the 1930s  
and was produced for  
a candy maker.  
If you look carefully,  
you will see  
each candy has a name next to it.  
This was the maker's catalog.  
Why have a book when a sheet will do?
