Bang bang! Splash splash! You're dead and wet. These are serious issues: A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Water Arms, shall not be infringed. It's written somewhere, and we have just incorporated our new tax-exempt lobbying branch, the National Water Rifle Association; if you don't sign up, we'll send the Waterbugs after ya'. This baby has a nozzle-speed higher than your fleeing foe. Fill with anything other than water and you get a spanking from your nearest parent.
