A watering can just like grandmother's. The design has an interesting past and is made by an interesting company. In 1952, Plastex was the first company in Finland to produce plastic with an injection-molding machine - they made it themselves! The can was modeled, as many of their first products were, on an existing metal product. This is the reason for the raised texture on the watering can - it is based on the hammered brass surface of the original. I found that detail to be very interesting, as is the long spout which is very handy while watering.
