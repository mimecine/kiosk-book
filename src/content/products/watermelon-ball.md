We could not resist, especially after a friend told us his aunt called them watermelon balls. Looking again, they do resemble a watermelon in a twisted way. These are made out of a hard plastic that makes them pretty special to the touch. They do not bounce! Good for throwing! Found in one of those fantastic old office supply / stationery shops that also carry toys and all sorts of interesting things. A few days after we ordered them for KIOSK, we spotted one on display at the Hong Kong Museum of History. It feels great to be great! Ha Ha!
