Soon we won’t even have much to cry about, as nature will be gone. Thoreau said that boxing nature into parks was not a nature for him nor a nature for any man. Michael Kim’s first book is devoted to newspaper clippings of people crying. When I feel like crying I go to this book and either cry or stop my whining. Nature can’t cry for itself, so we all have to cry about it a little.
