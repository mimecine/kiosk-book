Be prepared for when the thinning ozone layer arrives! These handmade welding masks are emblematic of the many industrious self-made people we met. Marco tried using it to mask his morning breath, no dice. Nevertheless, I'm really happy to have one of these since a need to weld something comes up every so many years. A must-have in every man and woman's toolbox!
