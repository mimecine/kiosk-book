A towel to remind me of the starched aprons and well-mannered waiters in Germany and a delicious meal I had of trout, cabbage and potato. Unlike the standard American dishtowel, it does not have any leaping lambs or bunnies in the grass playing peek-a-boo. No stripes, plaids or pastels. It's big enough to use on the shoulder and still have plenty of length to work with. There is a tab to hang it from - great quality, too. It's up to you to decide - take the white towel and see life one way, take the lambies and see it another. The choice of clarity is up to you.
