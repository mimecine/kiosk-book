By Komin Yamada who also designed  
the Global kitchen knife.  
The handle is based on  
a traditional pot for soba water.  
As it is hollow, it will not get warm.  
It reminds me of  
Jens Harald Quistgaard's designs for Dansk  
from the 1960s.  
In that way, it is inspiring to have the Japanese tradition and  
Danish modern references in one object.  
This pan is all about handles.
