"Headaches happen" and when they do, don't reach for the Tylenol or any of that other crap you have been fed. Dab a small amount of White Flower Oil on your temples and kick back for a moment. It also can be carefully inhaled to clear the sinuses. Named for the white narcissus and a staple in Hong Kong since the 1950s, we find it works!
