Yes, Made in China, I know - how can we include it in the American collection? But the object has an interesting story to tell. Schoenhut has been in business for 137 years, however, recently they had to ship their operations to China; they could not compete - too many companies in Asia were producing look-alikes and the American consumer did not value the difference. Now, they have their own facilities in China, established by the owners over a long development period and everything continues to be made in the same way, crafted entirely by hand. Schoenhut still has a warehouse and operations in Jacksonville, although with less staff, and their piano made in China is essentially identical to the one originally made in the States. They follow American guidelines in terms of materials. For us, we asked the question: is this product American? It originated here and the company is still American-owned. We feel it is neither here nor there, and that's okay in a global economy. The piano sounds great, is super durable, and how can you deny that the white is amazing? Giving musical instruments to a child is one of the best things you can do. If you have any doubt, just ask Margaret Leng Tan, the first woman to earn a Doctorate in Musical Arts at Juilliard and the first professional toy pianist - she worked with John Cage during the last 11 years of his life and bought her first toy piano in 1993. She plays on a Schoenhut. Very magical.
