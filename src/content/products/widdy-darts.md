American Darts vs. British Darts? Actually, the latter is the most commonly played dart game in the United States. American darts originated near Philadelphia in the early 20th century and spread from there into the coal regions of Northeastern PA. I had not thought much about American Darts, when, in our quest for products made near to New York, we found the Widdy dart. Established in 1910 and still a family business, Widdy is one of the last makers of American dartboards, and one of the last three producers of American-style darts. My mother's side of the family is from Northeastern Pennsylvania. When we were kids, my grandfather took us to these great bars up in PA located, oddly enough, on the ground floor of some old house, which is pretty common in Pennsylvania. It's like never leaving your living room: you have endless supplies of booze, and you can invite as many friends as you like over, without your wife or husband complaining. And guess what, best thing is, someone cleans up after you! Really, it's every man's fantasy! A home away from home, literally. Imagine the conversation: "Honey, I'm going over to Jack's House," aka Jack's Bar down on South 9th. "Ok, dear."
