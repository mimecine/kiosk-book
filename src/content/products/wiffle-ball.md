It's a ball. It's plastic. It's a Wiffle ball. You can pitch a curve, a straight, or a slider. Knowing Wiffle Ball for so many years, I was pleasantly surprised to find out it is still produced in the United States by the original family. What I never realized is Wiffle has its own set of rules and is a proper sport in itself. I don't understand why it has not become a standard hit outside of America. It is light, compact, and easy to play in small or large spaces. It feels so American, I would not be surprised if Alan Shepard had played it on the moon, post golfing moment.
