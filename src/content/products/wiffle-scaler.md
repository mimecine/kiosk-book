We all know the Wiffle Ball - but do you know the Wiffle Scaler (invented in 1972)? Wiffle, based in Connecticut, has been in business since the 1940s, producing their world famous toy. In Florida, I felt we needed a good beach toy, so we got the Scaler. It's easy to transport, so fling it around your neck for hands-free fun! Carry this around in your spring jacket pocket for when you are aching for summer to hit. Whip it out when you see a patch of grass. Flick your wrist like you are going to throw it really, really far - but don't let go. The doggie you brought along for a walk will jump and run. Psych! When he comes back with that sad look in his eye, really throw it this time. He will jump, run, catch, and bring your Wiffle Scaler back, wagging his tail for more, because he loves you. You are the best. How do you do it?
