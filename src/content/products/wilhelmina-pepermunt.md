A hard mint printed with Queen Wilhelmina's profile packed tight into a little box. Precious. Can be considered an edible cameo to pass on to all your ladies-in-waiting. Now, although it is dainty, don't let that fool you - this queen ruled for 58 years during the most turbulent times in contemporary history. She also, through her shrewd investments, became the world's richest woman in her time. This mint has a load roar/strong flavor.
