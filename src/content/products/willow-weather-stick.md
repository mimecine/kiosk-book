There are many ways to check the weather. Ask your grandma's elbow. If it's creaky, the storms are rolling in. Ask the wind. Wet your finger and stick it in the air. If those clouds are blowing your way, get your slicker out. Perhaps your phone is smart, and can provide you with the daily forecast. But the thing is, your grandma's elbow is certainly just old. And let's be honest, clouds don't always rain. And you shouldn't really be staring at your phone for all that long. What you should really do is put this stick on the side of the house, out on the porch, and look at it. If it's up, the weather is going to be fine. If it's down, be a good kid and get your jacket, gloves, and hat (if you're going out). Or stay inside and make some soup. The stick has told the truth for ages. Listen to the stick.
