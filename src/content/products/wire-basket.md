Actually, I have this basket. It's not a new find. I found it in my kitchen. Except, the three I have are from the 1930s. The backstory is that I was sitting in my kitchen, trying to finalize our first American collection, falling into a stupor. My glazed gaze wandered onto our shelves, and I saw the baskets. I have always liked them. They have a long history in the world, especially for me. I bought them when I first came to New York at what was then a large flea market. I searched for the maker, who told me they manufacture the gym basket the same way they always have. The number 8 is on each basket. My lucky number. _Ta Da_! Hope you like it!
