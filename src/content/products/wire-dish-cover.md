Cover your pretty serving dishes and delectable creations with this industrial beauty, produced since 1939. Sure, bargain shoppers can find knock-off versions of this in pink and green or orange at Crate & Barrel, but frankly, why? Buy the real deal once and keep it for the rest of your life, or until someone backs over it with the family wagon. Every French home with good food and smelly cheese plates has this readily stored at arm's reach in the cupboard. It's a necessity in the warm months to keep the flies at bay. Back off! Dirty flies! Back! No Roquefort for you, mes amours,or, as the chanson goes, "Adieu, mes amours."
