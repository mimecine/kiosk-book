This is not a lamp shade. It is actually  
a "light bulb protector"  
for construction sites.  
It is produced by the inventor and  
he holds the copyright in Japan.  
We noticed them in Tokyo.  
Far more elegant on the streets  
than the plastic ones we have.  
Almost Meiji-like,  
if you think of the glass shades from the period.  
A customer mentioned  
it would be nice on the floor, face-down.  
I agreed.  
Fixes to a light socket.  
The clip allows you to clip it to a table.
