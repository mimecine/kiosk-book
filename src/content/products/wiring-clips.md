I do my fair share of computer thingies, and, of course, I do hate cords. They are ugly any way you put it. These offset some of that ugliness. Hopefully, your guests will be intrigued enough to focus more on this brass clip/tie hybrid, than on the cord. Using the little hole in the center, nail the clip to the wall; the remainder wraps around the cord and holds it tight. After so many years of those ugly white plastic things, relief is finally here. Calm down, you aesthete!
