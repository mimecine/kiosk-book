Like most frying devices made out of iron, a wok shouldn't be cleaned with soap. If you do, it will rust more easily, and all of that seasoning that stayed in the pan will be gone forever. Woks should be washed with warm water and this type of brush. Rinse well and often and apply some strength when scrubbing, the bamboo holds up. If you do not use a wok, please don't try to apply makeup with these brushes. It will work but it will hurt, and you will blow through a lot of makeup! Can be used on cast iron pans, too.
