Glass, plastic, metal. What is the obsession with things entirely man-made? You know what looks better on the table and feels better in the hand? Wood. You know what looks better with age instead of just getting greasy, rusty, or dented? Wood. What have humans been making stuff out of for more than 100,000 years?

Wait, don’t eat the bowl, silly, unless you're a nasty termite. This is the typical Vermont-made wooden bowl that has made Vermont wooden bowls so famous. You know about them, right? Can you balance a bowl on your head? You know what that means, right?
