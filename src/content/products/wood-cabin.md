_Knock-knock_. Who needs camping when you can build your own log cabin? Leave your tent in the back of the closet, and let's go hunting! Whether it's grouse, ducks, deer, or a grizzly, this cabin will keep you cozy if you are mini-sized. Bring your doggy and canoe along; it's going to be a great weekend. We may even call in sick or leave a "gone fishing" note on the door! Handmade in Maine, totally kid-safe, with the human touch on each and every piece.
