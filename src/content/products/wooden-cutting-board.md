When I talked to you about the cedar cutting board from Japan, I mentioned the cutting boards from Vermont, and, well, how they never cut it (no pun intended). That was before I went to The Bowl Mill and I found this very Carl Andre piece of board. This is the type of board you will see in the design history books, representing the beautiful, simple, practical, functional, and humble objects people in America once made.
