There is a secret inside this little guy.  
Shake it.  
There is something in there,  
but what?  
The maker will not disclose how he makes this.  
He is now over 90 years old  
and can only see out of one eye.  
What he produces is very limited.  
And he will not be making them for long.  
We asked him if he has any students  
who know how to make the paperweight too.  
He sighed and said, "Yes, but not as good as me."
