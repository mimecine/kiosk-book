We do eat rice quite a bit at home  
since Yuki (of Yuki's Book)  
presented us with a rice cooker as a gift.  
To scoop up the rice in good,  
perfectly sticky, chunks,  
you need this type of flattened spoon.  
A short handle is needed  
to fool you to grip  
close to the end,  
which is better to work the  
quite resistant white fluff.
