A concave paddle, a bowl with a handle, a handle with a cup, a cupped end of a stick, soup elevator, yummy delivery, one for mom, one for dad and two for gramps! Too bland? A pinch of salt. Too salty? Add a cut up potato and hope it will work. Chris'ssoup turned out perfectly and he used this spoon every day in Colombia to stir his feijoa juice. As I mentioned, when I get to Colombia I am going to try all their juices.
