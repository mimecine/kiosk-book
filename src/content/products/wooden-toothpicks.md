If a king, queen, princess, or prince would ever, so ever, have food, candy, or gum stuck between their teeth, nowhere else would the court turn for toothpicks than this village. Yeah, there is always ivory, but that is sooo nineteenth century, and besides, ivory is procured in less-than-ethical ways. Wood has a nicer eco-echo and it burns without smelling like burnt hair. The picks resemble swords to keep your fighting tongue at bay! Originally carved by nuns in the area to decorate cakes, as the convents disappeared, the craft shifted to the general population; a handful of makers are producing them today. Really, although you can, I don't think you should use them on your teeth, but instead use them to decorate pretty things like your Thanksgiving pie or a Birthday cake or special vegan pop-tarts - you get the vibe.
