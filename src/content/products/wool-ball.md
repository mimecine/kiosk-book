A wool ball brought from Germany went over so well with my sister's kids I had to ask Carol, the woman who makes our baby slippers, to make up a bunch of these. Easy to learn juggling with and, if eaten, no harm can come. Tossing at the sibling brings no worries, either. Colors are attractive and it's an all-natural product. People talk about safety features and the need for them; this ball is safety in itself. I am certain Rudolf Steiner wrote a whole chapter on the value of the wool ball in children's play and interaction.
