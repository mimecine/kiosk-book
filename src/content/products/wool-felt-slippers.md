These slippers are not the most glamorous things you will ever put on your feet, but they are warm - something which is needed in even the best of New York's (drafty) apartments. Made of 100% Swedish felted wool, the product is simple and natural. They are produced by a small company that is obsessed with wool. Felting wool is a technique older than both spinning and weaving and felted materials are extremely durable and insulating. The slippers pack flat for easy traveling and are the perfect thing to offer guests if you don’t want their shoes in the house. Wool naturally absorbs and neutralizes odors, which is of course handy if you have someone with stinky feet over. Bye-bye to grandma’s terrycloth slippers. Lightly rubberized bottom for durability, they will last for years even under the worst conditions.
