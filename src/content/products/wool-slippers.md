Here is one of the most enjoyable objects we found in Romania. It was the typical tale of how things roll at Kiosk. We were visiting Mr. Pop in the village of Breb in Maramures. He had one pair of these slippers in his workshop for his personal use or he was selling them, we are not certain. Jason was really smitten but they were not his size; eventually we gathered the name and number of the maker, aka "the tailor." The next day we set out on foot to his village, passing an older couple making a haystack, picking apples off trees along the way, and following the footpaths Ionna knew from childhood. Just your typical day in the Romanian countryside. We arrived as the sun was setting, about two hours behind, asked at the local shop for "the tailor" and found him at home tending his bees. He left us on the front stoop to eat fresh walnuts while he finished up. After watching his group of cats maul a mouse for 20 minutes we went inside to explore the slippers. Jason got his pair, Marco got his, and I got mine. While Marco and Jason were chatting with him about life and the wonders of the world, I, with one eye on them and the room and one eye on the goods, dug through the various bags to lay out an assortment of what we would like to take. "The tailor" was quite pleased and we put in an order for the sizes we were missing. As some time had passed it was now pitch dark out. Just after the full moon, Ionna called her father to come and pick us up. We were sent on our way with more walnuts. A peaceful, idyllic day in the life of Kiosk. A little bit of a strange contemporary fairy tale indeed. No villains or evil nemeses this time.
