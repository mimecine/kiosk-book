He needs his hair. Aw, won't you help him put on his hair? Our man Willy hails from the small, industrious Pennsylvania town of Smethport, where toys have been manufactured since 1908. Willy's founder established a toy business based on magnets in 1923. His sons joined the company in the early '50s. In 1955, one son realized the potential of magnetic dust; at the same time, the US Army needed a three-dimensional map produced by vacuum-forming heated plastic. The other son then suggested using vacuum forming to create a frame to hold the magnetic powder. To fill the need for a fun background for the whole thing, a local artist created bald Willy. It all remains the same today. Times change and Willies may come and go, but this Willy is here to stay.
