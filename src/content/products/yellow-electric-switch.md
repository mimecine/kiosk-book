A switch typically found on the cord of a bedside lamp in any good Italian pensione, we are uncertain if this is even something that can be used, you are going to have to do your research. Consider the fact that if you can't use it in the way intended, it can stand-in as a beautiful stress toy or a twinkle on your shelf. Galalith is an incredible biodegradable material, although now, largely of the past. Made of casein and formaldehyde, at the height of its use in the 1930s 10,000 tons was produced annually. However, it's downfall was twofold. One, during WWII all available milk was reserved for human consumption and two, the material can not be molded, only produced in sheets and machined. As this part is machined by hand, it seems at only one place in Italy, there is a supply shortage with a 2-4 month production time and the item is well, a bit expensive.
