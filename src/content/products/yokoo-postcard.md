In Tokyo one night, we were taken to a pretty odd restaurant on the outskirts of the city. The name of the restaurant has escaped me (and the labyrinth of Google Street View in Japanese didn't help either). It was an experience. The restaurant was empty, aside from the owner who nervously laughed every time he saw us. If we hadn't been with our calm friends, I would have wondered if he wasn't planning to prepare us for the next day's bento. The restaurant was perched on the second floor and filled to the brim with Yokoo paintings, posters, postcards, and some fantastic promotional material for the restaurant specifically. We had to bring back a memory of this confusing night. A card that combines erupting Fujis, bullet trains, a young Tadanori Yokoo, sex as a gesture, a suicide, and finally, the logo of a famous Japanese brewery... this is as exciting as it gets. Yokoo also did some really racy posters, but I kept those entirely for myself. Look him up: Tadanori Yokoo, a very interesting personality.
