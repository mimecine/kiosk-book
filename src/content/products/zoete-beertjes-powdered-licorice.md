Did you know the Dutch are known for their licorice? So much so you'd think you would go there and find it everywhere. Not so! It's just a way of life, not a novelty. Kind of like burgers in the United States - everywhere, but so normal you don't even notice them. This powder has a salty overtone with a sweet licorice flavor.
